I considered your high \u0026 arduous station, your multiplied \u0026 very important duties, the wright of care \u0026 labor which must press you in the midst of a young family \u0026 a young seminary, \u0026 in the midst of building, \u0026 preaching \u0026c. I should not have had a heart to accuse you of neglect, if you had written nothing these two years. From the letter which you have written to your honored father, which I have had the pleasure to read, I have received very agreeable information respecting the adjustment of difficulties which burdened your mind before you left New England . You have reason to review the footsteps of providence relative to your undertaking, \u0026 the college to which you have devoted yourself, with wonder \u0026 gratitude I hope, dear Sir, that God will lead you on to greater usefulness, \u0026 that he will do much, by you, for the course of learning \u0026 religion in your extensive region. I am sensible that, with your constant employment as a preacher \u0026 as an instructor in the college, it will be difficult for you to become an adept in the circle of liberals arts \u0026 sciences. I think, however, that with good health, which may God grant you, \u0026 the diligence which has become habitual, you will attain what is essential to your place in the church, \u0026 in the Seminary. you are called rather to activity, than to study. And if you should begin, by constant \u0026 intense application to books, to reach after the sublime heights of knowledge which some favored mortals have attained, you would soon hear a voice that would check your ambitious projects, \u0026 call you to impart to thousands the knowledge you already possess. I most sincerely wish that your situation were such, that you could make it the business of your life to study the science of morals \u0026 religion, with other branches of literature connected with them. I should be glad to see what your abilities, with the aid of grace, could accomplish. But it cannot be. You must in a measure forego the pleasure \u0026 the honor of knowing, for the more benevolent pleasure of doing. It has been my favorite object to study. My heart has panted after all knowledge. But, in one way \u0026 another, God is laying obstacles in my way. The cares of a family, which has a slender support from my salary; the duties of my office, journies; visits; sleep; idleness; ___ these and other things consume my time, \u0026 I shall soon be an old man, in my grave, without even beginning what I intended to finish.__ of late I have had some unusual hindrances to improvement. you have doubtless"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8822/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1806 Dec. 15, Newbury [Massachussets, to] Charles Coffin, Greeneville, Tennessee / L[eonard] Woods : page 2"]},"width":1892,"height":2459,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8821~datastream~JP2/full/473,615/0/default.jpg","width":473,"height":615,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8821~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/1/page/tdh:8821","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/1/page/tdh:8821/656b6915eb6ed","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8821~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":1892,"height":2459,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8821~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8818/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"heard before this time, the dreadful affair of Ipswich. If I supposed it could be concealed from you, I would not divulge it. But I think it must have reached your ears \u0026 pained your heart, before now. I mean the violent, noisy wretched separation of Dr D. \u0026 his wife; the subsequent consequent council, of which I was a member; the unwillingness of the Dr \u0026 his family, that he should comply with the result; the publications of his Lon D. in his defence, the vindication of the council, \u0026 the letters, which closed the business, addressed to Marcus, i.e. id est D.D. in my own name. Never was a more wretched scene. Dr. G. Mrs D's brother, has interested himself much in the affair, \u0026 written sheets to Mr Sp. on the subject. It was, to me, a whole winters work, taking into view our meetings, conversation, writing, publishing \u0026c etcetera . I meant, at first, to mention it merely as one hindrance of my intended pursuits.__ I must now mention another. But I do it in confidence. You ask, \"how comes on the Panoplist ? Whose image \u0026 superscription does it bear?\" Possibly you will soon think, you have applied for information to a wrong source I ought, however, to be able to give you some information; for I have known everything respecting it from the beginning. The first year I was one of the three editors; this year I am one of the two. Mr Spring \u0026 Dr had strong objections against my engaging in the business. My prevailing motive was, that the Panoplist was likely to succeed, \u0026 to have much influence on the public, \u0026 that there was danger of hostility, implied, if not open, against the cause of consistent calvinism. I hoped, however vainly, that I should be able to do something towards saving it from injudicious management, \u0026 rendering it subservient to evangelical truth. My motive to continue in connexion with it is of the same nature. on hearing Mr S's objections lately repeated against my connexion with the Panoplist I seriously asked him, whether he advised me to leave it, \u0026 give up my place as editor to another? \"Is that, he said, the only alternative?\" I replied, yes. He then signified, that it was difficult to give advice.__ I was confident, from the beginning, it would occupy a different ground from the Magazine, \u0026 that the Mag. Magazine would not be injured by it. This has been the fact. The Mag. has had just about the same extent of circulation as it ha before the Panoplist was published. Besides which the Panoplist has had 1400 subscribers the first year, \u0026 nearly 1600 this. I have frequently engaged, that as soon as the Pan. Panoplist shall appear hostile to Hopkinsianism , I will relinquish it. The profits of the Panoplist have been devoted to Miss. Missionary Societies \u0026 to an evangelical school for making ministers under the guidance of Rev Reverend Mr Jackson of Dorset , I think, Vermont . But without enlarging, I will offer to send you all the numbers, gratis, if you can afford to pay the Postage. What it will be I know not. I will send them, if you choose, in some other way. you will, then, have opportunity to judge for yourself.___ as to the Miss. Society \u0026 Mag. I need not say much. They are nearly what they were when you left us. There is much want of mutual affection \u0026 confidence among Hopkinsians in this State. This occasions debility in the measures of the Miss. Society. But considerable good has been effected.___ as to the University;__ the liberal party, I mean the Unitarian s consider that they have bro't brought it under their influence. Dr Pearson , you have heard, long since resigned his professorship. He despaired of being useful at Harvard College. His chair , \u0026 that of Mr Webber remain vacant.___ The orthodox, in general, consider the University as lost to religion under the present influence. A Theological Academy is seriously talked of, in which all the orthodox in the State would cooperate. The present plan is to engraft it upon Andover Academy. It is to be a school like Doddridge s I hope it will succeed. Dr Morse is ardent in the pursuit of this object.

He often mentions you with great esteem.__ The ministerial union, concerning which you inquire, will, I hope, proceed. The motion was rejected \u0026 treated with contempt in convention. But the associations in the counties of Hampshire \u0026 Berkshire are already combined. Other associations are joining them. I think it will be an important body. The Westminster confession \u0026 the catechism are considered the basis of union. Mr Spring \u0026 Dr Emmons have had strong objections against it. But I think they will ultimately favor the plan \u0026 harmonize with the body of the orthodox. Dr Dwight says, \"a general association in Massachusetts must be formed, \u0026 the Panoplist must be supported.\" ____ Mr Niles 's work is in press. That giant has read a piece in his great association in opposition to the commonly received doctrine of the Trinity, \u0026 in favor of Sabellianism . His wife lately spent several days at Mr Spring's from whom he learned that Mr Niles embraced that theory. It may not, however, come into his work. What the laste men are after I cannot fully learn. I fear notions weaken the motives of the gospel, \u0026 go far towards annihilating moas moral obligations.__ Mavors history is well spoken of, but the america n edition, I find, does not meet a very ready sale. I am trying to introduce it into our Social Library. your request respecting it a dialogue for an exhibition in Greenvell Greeneville College is truly grateful to my feelings. But such are my engagements at present, that it is beyond my power to comply. I gave you an account of my connexion with the Panoplist to show you that I could do nothing of the kind you mention at present. But I forgot my particular object, \u0026 wandered as you see___ nothing pleasing in religious attention has appeared in my parish. Mr Allen of Bradford has had a very hopeful revival among his people, \u0026 in his own heart. Northhampton in this state has witnessed great displays of grace.___ I have omitted to tell you in its proper place that Mr Shistliff , if I spell his name right, is Professor of Divinity at Dartm. Coll. Dartmouth College He was formerly tutor. I long to hear whether the 50 thousands acres of land is granted to your College. May your enemies never prevail. Mr Doke is an old hog. I hope his tusk will do no harm. My family enjoyed health till last March. From that time Mrs Woods had a long \u0026 very alarming sickness. For about 8 months she was wholly separated from the affairs of the family. For several weeks her life hung in doubt. But through the mercy of God, she is now I believe completely recovered. Our children 2 sons \u0026 one daughter, are healthy \u0026 blooming. Samuel, seeing my paper tonight, asked what I was going to write, I told him, a letter to Mr Coffin.
