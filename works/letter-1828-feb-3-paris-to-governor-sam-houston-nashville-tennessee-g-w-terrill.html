On the contrary the \"Advertiser\" says the Gen General was welcomed by a greater concourse of people than was ever assembled in the City; which I have no doubt is true; also a cousin of mine, a commission merchant of the city writes me that business of every description was suspended during the old heros hero's stay ⁁ among them.
