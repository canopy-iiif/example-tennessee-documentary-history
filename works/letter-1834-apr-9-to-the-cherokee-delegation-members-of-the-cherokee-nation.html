It it appears that in addition to the injustice practiced on many of our cit people by suffering emigrants, who are citizens of the country to have places assessed to them which belong to their persons not to them, a number of persons negroes whites, spaniards, negroes, \u0026 mulattoes are permitted to alienate our land by having places assessed to them as emigrant Cherokees . Of this discription description is Hosea Morgan with a negro wife and six children of the same cast having no right nor title nor pretence of a title in the Nation. And yet he has enrolled with his family and has a field belonging to Mr. John Smith of Peach Creek in this Dist District . assessed to him. Woody Russel is another case. He is a white man his wife a colonial woman apparently Bright Multto Mulatto . they have no claim nor pretence of rights in the Nation. This Russel has had assessed to him the field of the Old Sailors widow and has produced a bill of sale for it which was witnessed by Wm William Griffin an emigrant. He has sold the good will of it and a white man named Joel McCrary has who has taken possession of the field and threatens to turn the old woman out of the house. The old lady denys having made any sale of the property, and the genuineness of the Bill of sale is rendered very doubtful from the circumstance that neither of the Russel nor Griffin can speak Cherokee and the old widow cannot speak English, so that it was impossible for them to make a bargain of that kind without an interpreter. Now we beg leave through you most earnestly to remonstrate against the practice of enrolling aliens to us"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:1437/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1834 Apr. 9, [to] the Cherokee Delegation / members of the Cherokee Nation : page 2"]},"width":2413,"height":3874,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:1436~datastream~JP2/full/302,484/0/default.jpg","width":302,"height":484,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:1436~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/1/page/tdh:1436","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/1/page/tdh:1436/656b626be368c","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:1436~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":2413,"height":3874,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:1436~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1435/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"and allowing them to sell our property and violate our rights in repo opposition to the protection stipulated to be extended to us in our Treaties with the United States.
