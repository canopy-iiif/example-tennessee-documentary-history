This \"union of the Whigs for the sake of the Union,\" is to adopt such measures as may seem most likely to rescue from impending danger, and still perpetuate, in all their original integrity, the invaluable blessings of our free institutions. Dearly purchased by the blood and toil of our forefathers, they must go down unimpaired, to a grateful posterity, if we be true to our responsibilities. That our political system would be exposed to corruption, especially from Executive usurpations, was foreseen and guarded against by the framers of the Constitution. But the experience of fifty years has fully shown that no checks can be made effectually, except by the unremitting vigilance of the People. The posture of our affairs, induced by the mal-administration of the General Government, calls loudly upon us for concerted action. In large assemblayes assemblies of the people, the information necessary to their enlightened and harmonious movement, is most readily and conveniently diffused. While they, together, inquire into, and expose the unnumbered delinquencies of the present administration, they will have the most favorable opportunity of expressing their opinions fully, as to the best mode of redressing their grievances. Their numbers, their intelligences, their virtue, will ensure success to the friends of \"Reform\" if they can only be brought to act in concert. Wherever such Conventions have been held, in various parts of the Union, they have greatly promoted our cause. The Whigs of the South and West have caught the enthusiasm so rapidly spreading over the country; and will, no doubt, come up to the approaching Convention in great strength. Animated by the most cheering prospect, we invite you to come, and swell, and share the triumph of patriots and reformers. We are, Sir, Very Respectfully, Your Ob't Serv'ts Obedient Servants . L.D.

Shelby ,"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7635/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7637/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7635/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Invitation to Whig convention] 1840 Jul. 4, Nashville, Tennessee [to] I.L.
