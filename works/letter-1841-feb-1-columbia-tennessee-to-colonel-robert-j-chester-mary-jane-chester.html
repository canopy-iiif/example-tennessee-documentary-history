I told him that $1 ½ was for the Paper. The examination is just over. It continued three days there there were not many people the first day ⁁ on account of the weather but the ⁁ third day the house was crowded. I missed but one question the whole time, and I do not think that I should have missed that one had I not been so much frightened. Mr Walkers family came every day. Cousin Sam said that he intended to write to you immediately after it was over. So I expect that you will receive his letter before you do mine. The Rev Reverend Mr Wheat of Nashville was here: and read out the Composition. Father you requested me in your last letter not to write so many letters. I will discontinue all my letters to every person with the exception of our family. I was very much distressed when I read that part of your letter.
