The first is a letter written by Colonel James Robertson to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray on August 3, 1788. In that letter, Robertson discussed episodes of violence between the Creeks and/or Cherokees and American settlers and troops. Robertson also offered McGillivray a gun and some land in the Cumberland region. The second part of the document is a detailed explanation of Robertson&#x27;s letter written by A.W. Putnam in 1859. Putnam provided an analysis of the historical context of the letter as well as his own opinions of the situations at hand at the time the letter was written. Putnam described the hostilities that existed between the Creeks and the American frontier settlers. He painted a portrait of the Creeks and the other tribes of the region as &quot;treacherous and wily and cruel savages&quot; who were working with foreign governments, particularly the Spanish, to undermine American aims. Putnam analyzed the connotation of Robertson&#x27;s words to McGillivray, by stating that it was both threatening and complementing at the same time. Putnam also related details of the state of the American government at the time, particularly the shift from the initial loose confederacy of states to the current federalist form of government. He discussed how the initial instability, particularly in the South, of the newly formed United States, desires to settle West, and ongoing conflicts with the Spanish complicated relations with the Native American tribes, specifically the Creeks. Putnam also reported his analysis of McGillivray&#x27;s character. McGillivray is presented as a cunning, influential man who was after his own interests and who was working with the Spanish to thwart American settlement. To Putnam, Robertson&#x27;s letter presented McGillivray with a compromise--that his financial and political success would be guaranteed as long as he used his influence to encourage American aims in the frontier. As Putnam noted, two years after Robertson&#x27;s 1788 letter, a treaty was concluded which established secure Indian land boundaries, ceded a large territory of land to the US, and gave McGillivray the rank of Brigadier General and a salary from the government. Thus, the US government was able to allay the Creek Nation."/><meta property="og:title" content="[Letter] 1788 Aug. 3, Nashville, [to] Honorable Alexander McGillivray / James Robertson.

September 1785 , he makes a remark about the \"settlements on the Cumberland , that, people there would do well to show a regard to the rights of others, and avoid further aggressions' The acknowledgement acknowledgment has been made by American Historians that McGillivray was always artful and skillful enough to defeat our State and national governments in negotiations with the Indians, until he attained his private ends, full indemnity for his alledged alleged losses. In further proof of his spirit, we quote the following remark from a long letter written by him in Septr. Septermber 1788 , to Panton , a Spanish merchant whom he had made a man of immense wealth by priviliged privileged dealings among the Indians: It will be noticed that this letter is only a month later in date than the one written to McGillivray , at the the the beginning of our communication: Speaking of proposed treaties for peace and boundaries"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7190/canvas/16"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7196/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7190/canvas/17","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1788 Aug. 3, Nashville, [to] Honorable Alexander McGillivray / James Robertson.

[Explanation of a letter] 1859, \"Opposition of McGillivray the Great Chief of the Creeks\" / A.W. Putnam - Untitled","description":"This document, entitled \"Opposition of McGillivray the Great Chief of the Creeks\" is comprised of two parts. The first is a letter written by Colonel James Robertson to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray on August 3, 1788. In that letter, Robertson discussed episodes of violence between the Creeks and/or Cherokees and American settlers and troops. Robertson also offered McGillivray a gun and some land in the Cumberland region. The second part of the document is a detailed explanation of Robertson's letter written by A.W. Putnam in 1859. Putnam provided an analysis of the historical context of the letter as well as his own opinions of the situations at hand at the time the letter was written. Putnam described the hostilities that existed between the Creeks and the American frontier settlers. He painted a portrait of the Creeks and the other tribes of the region as \"treacherous and wily and cruel savages\" who were working with foreign governments, particularly the Spanish, to undermine American aims. Putnam analyzed the connotation of Robertson's words to McGillivray, by stating that it was both threatening and complementing at the same time. Putnam also related details of the state of the American government at the time, particularly the shift from the initial loose confederacy of states to the current federalist form of government. He discussed how the initial instability, particularly in the South, of the newly formed United States, desires to settle West, and ongoing conflicts with the Spanish complicated relations with the Native American tribes, specifically the Creeks. Putnam also reported his analysis of McGillivray's character. McGillivray is presented as a cunning, influential man who was after his own interests and who was working with the Spanish to thwart American settlement. To Putnam, Robertson's letter presented McGillivray with a compromise--that his financial and political success would be guaranteed as long as he used his influence to encourage American aims in the frontier. As Putnam noted, two years after Robertson's 1788 letter, a treaty was concluded which established secure Indian land boundaries, ceded a large territory of land to the US, and gave McGillivray the rank of Brigadier General and a salary from the government. Thus, the US government was able to allay the Creek Nation.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1788-aug-3-nashville-to-honorable-alexander-mcgillivray-james-robertson-explanation-of-a-lett","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7190/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1788 Aug. 3, Nashville, [to] Honorable Alexander McGillivray / James Robertson.
