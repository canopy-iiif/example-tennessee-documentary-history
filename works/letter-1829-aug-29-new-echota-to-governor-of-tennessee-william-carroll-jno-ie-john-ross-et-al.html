The Cherokees express their unwillingness to convene a meeting with commissioners for the purpose of hearing proposals regarding removal to a territory west of the Mississippi River. They indicate that they have already informed the President and the Governor that they do not intend to sell more land now or in the future and convening a meeting for that purpose would be pointless.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1829-aug-29-new-echota-to-governor-of-tennessee-william-carroll-jno-ie-john-ross-et-al","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A718/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1829 Aug. 29, New Echota [to] Gov[erno]r of Tennessee, William Carroll / Jno [i.e., John] Ross ...
