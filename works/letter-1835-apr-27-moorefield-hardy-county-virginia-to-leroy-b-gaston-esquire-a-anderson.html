February 2nd past marked the 13th came to hand in the early part of the present month; an answer to which has been purposely deferred until this moment. You are aware that the month of April is to our profession in Va Virginia a month of business — The Cir. Sup. Circuit Superior Courts throng us — Our Elections take place — \u0026 all the et ceteras of such like occasions. In addition to all this — our muddy — haggard village, has in the providence of God been honoured honored with the Session of the Winchester Presbytery — which took its leave of us this morning. For these reasons \u0026 with the expectation of deriving some interesting intelligence from these scenes — I intentionally forewent (will that were pass) my usual promptitude, in replying to your anxiously looked for \u0026 welcomely recd received epistle. It is my purpose now to redeem my pledge \u0026 to gratify, in part at least, your wishes — You emphatically urge me to write — but what shall I write ? Nothingness \u0026 vanity seem inscribed upon every thing around me — \u0026 an incubus of dejection is loading me with its leaden weights. The heavens are shrouded in darkness — \u0026 my mind sympathetically partakes of the gloom — With such feelings \u0026 under such circumstances — you will realize but little pleasure in the presence of a barren \u0026 lifeless epistle. But such as I have I give out thee. You express the wish — that when I started my friend Joe Fellows for the South — I had stuck to him \u0026 thus been dragged out of this slough of despond — Our wishes are mutual. But dire necessity or the illusions of hope — have fixed me to the spot — \u0026 altho although it is any thing other than an oasis — I can not tear myself from it — as yet . True I am not of the seed-royal — Either by descent or adoption nor will I ever be by matrimonial amalgamation. But having a little of the old roman spirit in me — I cannot but assert my rights — nor shall it e'er be said of me — \"He was banished the land of his birth or adoption\" — In plain English — you know Efforts have ever been making by some of the line to expel me from their borders — \u0026 to fix the brand of a stranger upon my forehead \u0026 exclude me from their little comth of privileges — \u0026 the means have been as various as their desires.
