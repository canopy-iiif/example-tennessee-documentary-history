Though the Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable and heretofore unquestioned right to the lands they occupy until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government. Yet it may well be doubted whether those tribes who reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States can with strict accuracy be denominated for foreign nations. They may now more correctly perhaps be denominated domestic dependent nations. They occupy a territory to which we assert a title independent of their will, which must take effect in point of possession when their right of possession ceases. Meanwhile, they are in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.

The Cherokees sought the opinion of the court on the issue of Georgia's right to extend its jurisdiction over the Cherokee Nation, effectively depriving them of their sovereignty. Marshall's decision here indicates that the Cherokees cannot be strictly considered foreign nations, as they had argued, and are instead considered \"wards of the state,\" or \"domestic dependents.\" This decision was delivered in the January term of 1831 and is of extreme significance in the development of Indian Removal issues.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/opinion-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states-1831-jan-delivered-by-chief-justice-john-marshall-","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A434/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1831 Jan. / delivered by Chief Justice [John] Marshall on a motion of the Cherokee Nation for a writ of injunction and subpoena against the State of Georgia"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"opinion-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states-1831-jan-delivered-by-chief-justice-john-marshall-"},"buildId":"kvsAAELcAlTlGqjYBAUvs","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
