The most desirable part of the state is that portion which lies between the place Illinois \u0026 Mississippi rivers. Called the military military trail. And of that portion, Warren Co.

It is probably the best portion of North America . Stone-coal is abundant. I was better pleased with Warren than any part of the western country I have seen.
