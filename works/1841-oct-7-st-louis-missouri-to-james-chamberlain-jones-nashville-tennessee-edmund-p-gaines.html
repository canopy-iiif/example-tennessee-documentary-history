Gaines - Untitled","description":"This is a letter from General Edmund Pendleton Gaines to James Chamberlain Jones, Governor of Tennessee. It is dated October 7, 1841. Gaines writes in reference to a recent Act of Congress authorizing a \"House Squadron\". He is concerned that the port towns of the United States are not defendable against ships running under steam power. Gaines is also concerned that a war with a European power is possible. He believes that the Native Americans he is defending the Western Frontier from might unite with a European aggressor. Gaines offers recommendations for building and staffing forts, and mentions the need for rail roads west of the Mississippi River. Gaines lists some ideas for how to deal with the Native American and European threats. He also lists his objections to current U.S. military policy, especially in regards to forts and New Orleans' defence against war ships under steam power.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/1841-oct-7-st-louis-missouri-to-james-chamberlain-jones-nashville-tennessee-edmund-p-gaines","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A5425/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"1841 Oct. 7, St. Louis, Missouri [to] [James Chamberlain] Jones, Nashville, Tennessee/ Edmund P.
