Tennessee Bristol School July 7 1834 Dear Brother, in Christ, I hardly hope to make this letter interesting because you so frequently read and have accounts similar to it. I am therefore chiefly prompted by a spirit of remembrance and friendship for you, and other good friends in Farmington , to whom I am greatly indebted. Direct to Knoxville E. Tennessee We are located about 9 miles from Knoxville , in a very romantic spot, and as wicked a neighborhood as it is romantic. I can convey to you but a small part of its history in this letter. A thousand things come before me, which I cannot appropriately express, but which I would be glad you understood. No pen can describe the reflections, and feelings of an exile from good society, and gospel dispensation. This is the situation of Mother, two sisters, and myself. But we are happy. Our log cabin protects us from inclement weather, food and clothing are abundant, and our health is prolonged. I said we had no good society; (I mean such society as is called good in New England .) It is truly so. And it is just the society, for which every pious emigrant, should settle in this country. Here theres no profanity, no desecration of the Sabbath, no lack of integrity, no want of christian influence, and education, and no settled spirit of indolence in the West, certainly might every christian throughout New England be justified in spending his days, in that circle of relatives and acquaintance so pleasing to his jusl juvenile life. With all this knowledge before us, we have deliberately concluded to settle here for life.

At present we are doing little good except in our school, which consists of between 60 and 70 pupils; 45 of whom are from abroad. Many of them are the most promising young men and women preparing for Teaching. The money and books given by our Farmington friends are of inestimable value. We would they knew our gratitude.

Not the smallest gift will be forgotten of God, at judgement. \"Tho ye did it to the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto me.\" I regret that I did not accept the kind offer of the S. School, and take those question books at the Hall not in use; for we have frequent calls from neighboring schools beside our own wants, to supply. Should you, and our friends in Farmington think best at any time, to make up a box, its contents will be disposed of, we trust profitably to the course of Christ. You recollect, dear brother, what I told you at our last meeting, with respecting Sectarian influence in our S. School. We have fully realized our anticipations.

Alas! this is literally a heathen country! Judging from the numbers of professions of religion, the bigotry, superstition, error, intemperance, and profanity, with which this country is filled, I am led to say, there is as much need of missionary effort in behalf of it, as in behalf of the Roman Empire . Oh! when will men learn to do as they ought! When will the inhabitants of this great valley, see eye to eye, and act in concert with the truths of the Bible! We are about building a log-school house for the accommodation of the poor in our neighborhood; which school, will be superintended by a female who will only teach the primary branches. At the end of the half session, which is about one week hence, I have engaged to attend a protracted meeting, with one of our home missionaries about 40 miles distant.
