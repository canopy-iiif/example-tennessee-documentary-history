I spent several days in Davidson on my way from Marshall and I thought I done some decent courting, at any rate, I know I courted at a decent looking girl; but I was in the worst fix for doing anything of the kind that I ever was on any life, The weather as you will probably remember, was oppressively hot \u0026 I generally lead two of the worst sort of boils under one or the other arm: there causes kept me a little more than half sick \u0026 at last forced me off a little sooner than I would have left under other circumstances. But not with standing all these difficulties I think I got along tolerably well. The business of selling goods is with us, at this time, quite dull; people generally have tolerable prospects for crops of corn \u0026 tobacco- very little excitement about the Govs Governor's election.
