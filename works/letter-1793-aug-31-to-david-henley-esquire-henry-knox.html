In the letter, Knox appointed Henley as an agent for the War Department in the Southwest Territory. Knox further detailed the duties of Henley's new position, which mostly included regulating payments and supplies of all sorts for the troops of the Southwest Territory and also preventing and correcting improper expenditures. David Allison was appointed as a subordinate paymaster, who would be working under Henley. Henley's position was initially established on a temporary basis in response to recent occurrences in the Southwest Territory that required the deployment of more troops and greater expenditures by the War Department.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1793-aug-31-to-david-henley-esquire-henry-knox","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A9632/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1793 Aug. 31, [to] David Henley Esq[ui]r[e] / Henry Knox"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1793-aug-31-to-david-henley-esquire-henry-knox"},"buildId":"kvsAAELcAlTlGqjYBAUvs","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
