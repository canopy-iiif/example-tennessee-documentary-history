The delegation informs Porter that none of the Cherokee claims for property loss have yet been paid, under provisions of the Treaty of Tellico (1804), nor have claims for improvements under the treaties of 1817 and 1819 been paid. In addition, they also discuss lingering questions regarding the continuing education of Cherokee children and the unauthorized payment of a portion of the Cherokee annuity to Cherokees in Arkansas.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1829-jan-29-washington-to-peter-b-porter-secretary-of-war-jno-ie-john-ross-et-al","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A725/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1829 Jan. 29, Washington [to] P[eter] B.
