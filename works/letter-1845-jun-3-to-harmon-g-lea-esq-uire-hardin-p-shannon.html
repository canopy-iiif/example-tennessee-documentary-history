Each candidate has his friends but it is quite clear that the issue is now, as it has been all along between Cleveland \u0026 myself. You have some idea how the canvass has progressed. I could fill this sheet in a detail of the matter but must be brief. On yesterday (Monday) we met at Rutledge \u0026 made some speeches — Col. McGinnis merely declared himself a candidate — Cleveland followed in a rather singular speech — an attempt to vindicate himself \u0026 his declarations. Since the commencement of this canvass — \u0026 seemed to try to make the impression that he was the champion of our cause \u0026c et cetera — Esq.

I expressed my willingness to submit the whole matter to the people to be determined by their vote en masse on 21st instant — at the time of the proposed adjustment of the Congressional matter. Cleveland would not agree to it, unless I would consent to go \u0026 remain perfectly still \u0026 quiet until after the election. The blood of a freeman flows in my veins. I felt as freeman. I acted as a freeman. I would not consent to such arrangement. It was ingenerous ungenerous to say the least of it. He knew that my acquaintance was limited throughout the county — at least in some portions of it \u0026 thought to take advantage of it. It is characteristic of the man. — The next proposition that was made was to this effect — that we leave the decision of the matter to the Grand Jury — the Court sitting \u0026 appointing at the time. Cleveland \u0026 Moore agreed to it immediately . I did not feel willing to enter into any such arrangement, without taking time for reflection — I told them so — considerable excitement got up — a good deal of warmth manifested. the advocates of the new proposition urging me to decide instantly whether or no.— I told them I would let them know my determination on Saturday next at Beans Station — Moore was willing to consider the matter binding on him, but Cleveland would not, \u0026 remind us I thought disposed to agree to nothing.
