My horse is a very good horse, but he will be much fatigued going through the mud, therefore I would like to exchange him with you or brother for a fine horse. Please keep it in mind, for I shall not have time to rest my horse while there. I must inform you concerning a matter which I gave you a hint of last spring, and I believe asked your advice, but never received it, or any ⁁ en couragement whatever, however I suppose, you reposed much confidence in me, and thought I ought to judge for myself concerning a matter, upon which so much of my prosperity and happiness in life depended, and from your silence, such was your opinion, at least taken by me for granted, that I am engaged to be married to Miss Mary A Perkins , who is not beautiful, but very genteel in her appearance, very modest \u0026"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6085/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:6090/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6085/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1833 Dec. 23, Williamson County, Tn.
