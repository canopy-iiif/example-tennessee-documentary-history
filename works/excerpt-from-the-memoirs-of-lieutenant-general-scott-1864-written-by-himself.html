Autobiography of Winfield Lieut.-General Scott , written by Himself . New York , 1864 . Vol. 1, p. 318. The Cherokees were an interesting people - the greater number Christians, an and many as civilized as their neighbors of the white race. Between the two colors intermarriages had been frequent. They occupied a contiguous territory - healthy mountains, valleys, and plains lying in North Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and Tennessee . Most of their leading men had received good educations, and possessed much ability. Some were quite wealthy in cultivated farms, good houses, cattle of every kind, and negro slaves . Gardens and orchards were seen everywhere and the women graceful, with, in many cases, added beauty. Of course the mixed races are here particularly alluded to. The mountaineers were still wild men, but little on this side of their primordial condition. The North Carolinians and the Tennesseans were kindly disposed towards their red brethren. The Alabamians were much less so. The great difficulty was with the Georgians (more than Half the army), between whom and the Cherokees there had been feuds and wars for many generations. The reciprocal hatred of these two races was probably never surpassed. Almost every Georgian , on leaving home, as well as after their arrival at New Echota , - the centre center of the most populous district of the Indian territory - vowed never to return without having killed at least one Indian. This ferocious language was the more remarkable as the great body of these citizens - perhaps, seven in ten - were professors of religion. The Methodists, Baptist, and other ministers of the Gospel of Mercy, had been extensively abroad among them; but the hereditary animosity alluded to caused the Georgians to forget, or, at least, to deny that a Cherokee was a human being."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/388/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:389/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A388/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/tdh","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A388","label":{"en":["[Excerpt from the Memoirs] of Lieut[enant] General Scott, 1864 / written by himself"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/subject/cherokee-indians-social-conditions.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/place/southern-states.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/format/diaries.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/date/1864.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"[Excerpt from the Memoirs] of Lieut[enant] General Scott, 1864 / written by himself - Untitled","description":"This document is a typed excerpt from vol.1 of the Memoirs of Lieut.- General Scott, published in 1864.
