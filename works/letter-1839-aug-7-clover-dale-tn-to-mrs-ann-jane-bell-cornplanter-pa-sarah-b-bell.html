We all deeply sympathize, with you in your looss loss , it would have given us much pleasure to have ⁁ seen the dear little creature, Yet my dear sister why should you grieve so much now when it is taken away, as I hope there is no doubt on your mind but that it is happy, when our friends are taken away from us by the hand of death and we have doubts as to their situation in another world, then it is the human heart must blead bleed , but when the our loss is their gain why should we greive grieve . You say the company of one of us would do you good, with pleasure would I resign the good society and preaching which I now enjoy to be with you, if it would add to your happiness. yet my Fathers health would not at this time admit of it, I do not think it would be right for me to leave him at this time were it ever so convenient I do not feel satisfied to leave home one night at a time which I have seldom done for the last six month Mag Margaret and I are going to Dr. Carters to morrow tomorrow to see Mrs Dabney . My Fathers health has been much better this week than usual Wm. William has been working near the house this week and he goes often to see him.
