Dear Sir; I have come into the Nation by appointment of the Secy Secretary of War, to see you and other principal men on a subject interesting to the Cherokees as well as the the United States . It is scarcely necessary to say that the President of the U States feels a deep interest in the removal of the Cherokees West of the River Mississippi . This you have been informed of by himself. He believes that it will tend to the permanent advancement of the prosperity of the nation, and will prevent those unpleasant bickerings that are sure to arise from the extension of Jurisdiction by the adjoining States over that part of the nation within their respective chartered limits. Without entering further into a train of reasoning upon this subject, permit me to say that I am directed to make the plain, simple proposition to you. Will you agree to meet commissioners to be appointed by the President, at such time as might best suit the convenience of both parties, for the purpose of discussing the subject of the Cherokees removing West of the River Mississippi . You will then have the opportunity of hearing the propositions of the government. If they are such as meet the approbation of the nation, you will, of course agree to them.
