Dear Reader ; My endeavour endeavor to afford you some consolation and an alleviation and exemption from pain and affliction, I deem one of the most glorious achievements of my life. Nothing could afford me more pleasing and durable satisfaction, than to know myself the author of so much good to thousands, as the publication of the following receipts must produce. They were discovered, tried, and their use ascertained and sanctioned, by the lengthy and extensive practice of an Indian, who devoted his whole life to curing the diseases and aiding the indigent. He laboured labored from motives of pure humanity, possessing the most willing hand and feeling heart. From the same motives, was it, that (unwilling his much experience should be lost to the world,) he placed these receipts in my hand. When this first happened, elated with the prospect of success, in the acquisition of wealth and honour honor , which I supposed they might infallibly secure to me, I determined to keep them from the eye of the world. But thanks to the great Author of Nature, my heart of stone is converted into one of the most tender sensibility. I now feel, that it is an obligation I owe my fellow mortals to contribute all in my power to their necessities and comforts; and as the hand of disease more completely than any thing else, deprives them of these, so by disclosing a method by which they may be lessened, both in danger and frequency, I shall most effectually fulfil my purpose. The diseases for which these receipts were prescribed embrace most that are of common occurrence, especially of much importance and consequence.

Drink often of tea made strong of tag Alder and Oak Bark, and take every other day a portion of Culver's Physic. For a Cancer. Take the berries of Poke Weed, or Cokum, squeeze out their juice, add to it the same quantity of cream, and simmer it down to the consistence of an ointment. If this is used in the early stage of the disease, it is a certain, safe, and easy cure. It should be rubbed on every six or eight hours until it has some effect. For Worms. If they rise up into the throat so that the child cannot breathe, or is likely to have a fit, drop a few ashes into some water and let it be drinked. After this, use for one day a tea made of Garlicks, Rue, and Wormwood. Then give a dose of Butternut Physic, and the worms will be speedily evacuated. For the sting of Wasps and other Insects. Hold the part that is stung for a few minutes, over the steam of hot water. Then take some clean mud, warm it a little and apply it. This will stop its smart and prevent its swelling. For Asthma and Phthisic. Take the roots of Skunk Cabbage, steep them well and strain off the liquor. Add to it a little juice of Garlicks, and take it often.
