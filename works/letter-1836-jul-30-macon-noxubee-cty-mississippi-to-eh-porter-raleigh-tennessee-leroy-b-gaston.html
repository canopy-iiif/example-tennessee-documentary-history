My opinion, from the best information recd received is that you will do well by occupying the stand at Aberdeen at as early a date as you possibly can. It is the most eligible point= and commands a more extensive fertile section of country than any other I have heard spoken of, unless it be Gainsville some distance below. The latter place had the advantages of being more central and accessible. They are both cut-off in a measure, from a winter intercourse with the interiour interior by the prairies, a season of the the year too the most important for the advantage of your business. It would be a spur and spring to the business which I think would never subside, and would add incalculably to its profits, were you to occupy one of those stands this fall. I would earnestly advise, if possible, to forego some of your already conceived plans, and strain a point to do so. The farming interest of the country is just now in the stage of incipiency, and presents the fairest opportunity that it ever will for you to lay fast hold of it. I would suggest that you send Mr Charr if you have no one to spare from your own shop to put in one of those places.

I bought out his former partners interest, at cost and six pr. ct. per cent upon 12 mos. months time. And I am here now on a purchase of Articles that we need to replenish the stock, which we are now obliged to do in consequence of this former partner's having failed to go to Mobile according to promise. We get goods from overstocked merchants in this place at New York cost and twenty pr ct per cent with 6 \u0026 12 mos months time.
