In the city, the Native American Democratic ticket has prevailed; but the Whigs are beaten badly, and knowing they would be beaten, many of them abandoned their own regular ticket, and voted for the Native ticket (a branch of the democracy mostly friendly to Tyler and Calhoun ) in order to beat the regular locossco ticket. Of three, our ticket was much the strongest, but the natives and Whigs united, beat us. The Whigs do not exult in the result—it has shown their weakness. Harper the Mayor elect, called a Whig is a Calhoun man—and has been a Tylerite.— In Kentucky , our friends are P.S.
