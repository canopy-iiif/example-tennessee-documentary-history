Governor Hall several times narrowly escaped being killed by the Indians when a boy, and his father and two of his brothers were killed by them. 1797 - 1805 he represented Sumner County in the General Assembly. His name does not appear on the roll again until 1821 when he was elected to the Senate of which he was a member until he became Governor. In the meantime he was engaged with General Jackson in his military campaigns; Hall was Brigadier-General in the war of 1812 , and was with Jackson in every hard fought battle, both against the Indians and the British . William Hall was never a candidate for Governor and retired to private life when his successor was inaugurated; but in 1831 he was elected a member of Congress. After leaving Congress he lived on his private estate which was called \"Green Gardens,\" near Castilian Springs , until his death, which occurred October 7, 1856 .
