SHORT DESCRIPTION, \u0026c. et cetera THE Tennessee government, or the territory of the United States, south of the river Ohio, is that tract of country, which was ceded to the United States by the state of North Carolina , in the year 1789. It is situated between the parallels of 35 degrees and 36 degrees 30 minutes, extending from the great Iron mountain to the river Mississippi . WHEN we cast our eyes on the map of any country, especially the map of a new country, in which little else is seen than the situation of mountains, rivers, and plains, we are desirous to know what is the state of its soil and climate; what are the advantages its inhabitants may be expected to enjoy, or the difficulties under which they must labour labor . A general answer to these questions, as they respect the Tennassee Tennessee government, is the object of this publication. WE discover, at first sight, that the southern territory is cut into eastern and western divisions, by Cumberland mountain, a ridge near thirty miles broad; and it is probable, that the commercial connexions connections of people who live in the eastern division, may be different"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/2"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9445/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/3","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Book] 1793, A Short Description of the Tennassee [Tennessee] Government : page 4"]},"width":1738,"height":3021,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9444~datastream~JP2/full/435,755/0/default.jpg","width":435,"height":755,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9444~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/3/page/tdh:9444","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/3/page/tdh:9444/656b69b63a2f1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9444~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":1738,"height":3021,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9444~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/3"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/3/annopage-3","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/3/annopage-3/annotation-3","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"(4) from those of the western inhabitants. The great island on the Holston river, is not abve above 340 miles from Richmond in Virginia , along a good waggon wagon road, whence we may conclude that the settlers on Holston will preserve a considerable intercourse with the Atlantic states: but people who live to the westward of Cumberland mountain, will send their produce to market by means of the Mississippi. This remarkable difference in their situation will probably induce the inhabitants of those districts to employ themselves differently, for the most proper or profitable productions in one settlement, may not be most profitable in the other. THE Holston settlement contains 28,649 inhabitants, though in the year 1775 it hardly contained 2000. The land in this settlement is generally fertile; but the face of the country is much broken. Placed, as it is, between two large mountains, we may readily suppose that the farmer never suffers by the want of rain. The soil produces wheat, barley, Indian corn, hemp, and flax, in great perfection. Physicians have not hitherto found their way to that country, for the people have not been sick. They enjoy a temperate climate, ease, and abundance. IRON ore abounds in that country. A capital furnace and forge have lately been erected on Holston, near the Virginia line. There is a bloomery below the mouth of Wataga Watauga , and another 25 miles above the mouth of French Broad. There are also sundry leadmines in the settlement, one in particular on French Broad river, that produces seventy five per cent percent in pure lead. THE greatest part of the Tennassee Tennessee government lies on the west side of Cumberland mountain; and though that country has hardly been settled ten years by civilized men, it naturally claims the greatest share of our attention, because it is extensive, and will probably become the residence of a numerous and powerful colony.

The natives, who formerly inhabited that country, must have been very numerous; we seldom go more than five or six miles along the banks of Cumberland river, without finding a large burying-place, the evident remains of a considerable town. As the Indians had their choice of land, and do not appear to have been equally numerous in other places, we may suppose they found this to be a soil on which they could live with greatest ease. Of the Rivers. FROM the face of the map it appears, that this country is well intersected by rivers, and most of those rivers are navigable by large boats; some of them by ships. TENNASSEE Tennessee river is navigable by vessels of great burden to the Muscle Shoals; those shoals are only to be passed in small boats or batteaux; from the Muscle Shoals the river is navigable in boats of 40 or 50 tons burden, to the Virginia line. CUMBERLAND river is navigable in large vessels to Nashville , and thence in boats to the mouth of Obas river. DUCK river is navigable in boats about 90 miles. The waters of Harpath, Cany-fork, Stones, Roaring and Red river, have uniformly a gentle current towards the mouth, whence they are all navigable in boats for a considerable distance.

These rivers in general are deep, and flow with a gentle current, unincumbered with rocks or rapids, until they reach the barren or broken tract in which they rise. Each of those rivers is bordered by a small strip of low ground, 60 or 80 wards wide, and this again is terminated by a gentle slope or secondary bank. In order to understand the use, perhaps the cause of this remarkable circumstance, an inner and an outer bank to each of those rivers, it should be remembered that the river Mississippi, during the month of May, rises perpendicularly near 25 feet, at which season the low ground on both sides of that river is covered with water, to the depth of 12 or 18 inches. This inundation, on the west side of the river extends to a great distance, for the country seems to be lower in that direction, and some of the waters of that river find their way to the ocean by other channels. On the east side of the river, the inundation hardly extends above five miles; at that distance the waters are restrained by a secondary bank, which runs parallel to the general course of the river. This outer bank is properly the beginning of high and dry land. It is obvious, that during those spring floods, the rivers, which run into the Mississippi, must suffer a considerable interruption. Their current is affected 10, 15, or 20 miles from the mouth, and they overflow their banks. On those occasions, the secondary bank of those small rivers becomes necessary, for it prevents the adjacent land from being overflowed, except the narrow border above described. The industry of a small French colony at New Orleans has given a sufficient proof that the inundations of the Mississippi may be restrained by artificial banks, by which means arable land has been and may be secured, that is hardly equaled in value by any known lands, except in Egypt ."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/5"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9442/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/6","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Book] 1793, A Short Description of the Tennassee [Tennessee] Government : page 7"]},"width":1766,"height":2997,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9441~datastream~JP2/full/442,749/0/default.jpg","width":442,"height":749,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9441~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/6/page/tdh:9441","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/6/page/tdh:9441/656b69b97c10b","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9441~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":1766,"height":2997,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9441~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/6"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/6/annopage-6","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/6/annopage-6/annotation-6","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"(7) Of the Timber, Plants, Animals, \u0026c. et cetera THE land on the waters of Tennassee Tennessee and Cumberland rivers is generally well timbered.

The general growth is popular, hickory, black-walnut, buck-eye, or the horse- chesnut chestnut , sycamore, locust, and the sugar-maple. The under growth, in many places, is cane 15 or 20 feet high, so close together, as to exclude all other plants; where the cane does not abound, we find red-bud, wild-plumb, spice-wood, red and white mulberry, gensang ginseng , Virginia and Seneka Seneca snake-root, angelica, sweet-anise, ginger, and wild-hops. The glades are covered with clover, wild-rye, buffalo-grass, and peavine. On the hills, at the heads of rivers, we find stately red-cedars; many of these trees are four feet in diameter, and forty feet clear of limbs. In those hills there is abundance of iron-ore, lead-ore, and coals. Copperas and alum fit for use have been gathered in caves near Nashville. ON the rivers that run into the Mississippi, the growth is nearly the same as on the waters of Cumberland river.

A county was also laid off on those waters, called Davidson, to commemorate a brave and popular officer who fell in the service of his country. The bounty lands were run off by surveyors appointed for that purpose; and in a few years a considerable number of the original grantees fold their titles to other persons, and the settlement has lately been increasing very fast.

THE farmers on Cumberland river, for the sake of describing their lands, distinguish them by first, second, and third quality. Land of the first quality will bear Indian corn or hemp; but it will not bear wheat without great reduction. Land of the second quality does not bear wheat to advantage until it has been reduced by two or three crops of corn, hemp, tobacco, or cotton. Land of the third quality bears every kind of grain, that is usually sown on dry ground, in the Atlantic states. It is agreed by all who have visited the Cumberland settlement, that 100 bushels of Indian corn are frequently gathered from an acre of their best land. Sixty or seventy bushels from an acre is very common; but the farmer who expects to gather such a crop must be careful, while the corn is soft, to guard it against bears and racoons raccoons .

The usual crop of cotton is 800 pounds to the acre; the staple is long and fine. It is alleged, however, that the lands on the small rivers that run into the Mississippi, have a decided preference to those on the Cumberland river, for the production of cotton and indigo. No experiments have been made on land near the Mississippi, within the ceded territory; but there is a small settlement further down the river, within the limits of the United States, on a similar soil, where the growth and quality of cotton is so remarkable, that its culture is more profitable than any other crop. The soil on those rivers is deep and light, having a small mixture of sand with a black earth; hence, as the planters allege, it proves favourable favorable to the culture of all kinds of roots, as well as of indigo and cotton.

The piercing northerly winds that prevail, during the winter, in the Atlantic states, seldom molest the inhabitants on Cumberland river for they have no great mountains to the north or the westward. The inhabitants of the Atlantic states are also subjected to sudden changes in the atmosphere, arising from their vicinity to the ocean; the air that comes from the surface of the sea, especially from the war Gulf-stream in winter, must by very different in its temperature from the air that comes across cold and high mountains; but the great distance between the Cumberland settlers and the ocean, considering that many great mountains are interposed, effectually secures them against the bad effects of those sudden changes.

Lime-stone is common on both sides of Cumberland mountain. The bottom of a river on the west side of the mountain, is frequently a continued stratum of this rock. It is generally known that small streams of water are apt to disappear in countries that abound in lime-stone limestone : this is occasioned, doubtless, by the great fissures that are common in those rocks; from the same cause it probably arises, that we seldom find marshes or stagnant waters where there is much lime-stone. In this territory we find no stagnant waters; and this is certainly one of the reasons why the inhabitants are not afflicted with those bilious and intermitting fevers, which are so frequent, and often fatal, in the same latitude near the coast in Carolina . Whether it proceeds from the goodness of the water, the purity of the air, the temperature of the climate, or whatever else may have been the cause, the inhabitants of that country have certainly been remarkably healthy, ever since they settled on the waters of Cumberland river, whence it appears that the climate is healthy and pleasant. MEN frequently change their habitations in quest of a better place; and the man, who can enjoy the greatest degree of health, ease, and plenty, is generally supported to have the most desirable habitation. Keeping this remark in view, perhaps there are few places that present fairer prospects to the man who is looking for a settlement. Few places are more healthy; there is none more fertile; and there is hardly any other place, in which the farmer can support his family in such a degree of affluence. The soil is not only fertile, but easily cultivated.

When we consider the quantity of food that must be laid up for the necessary support of stock in cold climates, we may fairly calculate, that half of the farmer's time is spent in making provision for his cattle, or in sheltering himself from the weather. In the southern territory, cattle at present support themselves among the reeds, pea-vines, rye-grass, and clover; but when the progress os cultivation shall have destroyed the wild range, it is obvious, that the sodder and straw obtained from the ordinary crops, will be more than sufficient to support the cattle. LET us review this account. It is granted, that, in cold climates, more than half of the farmer's time is lost from labour labor by intemperate weather, or taken up in working for the support of his cattle; this gives an odds of two to one in favour favor of the country that has been described. We are next to recollect, that one day's labour labor , in this country, produces more than twice as much grain, or other provisions, as it produces in common land, and in a northern climate; this gives another difference of two to one, which makes four to one throughout the year. But, considering that industry, in all countries, bears some proportion to the necessities of the inhabitants, we shall suppose, that the farmer, in this territory, during the year, raises only twice as much provision for his family, as he could raise on common land in a colder climate; and the difference, as it respects himself, must be immense.

Sugar, coffee, and tea belong to this class; as do sundry articles of foreign dress. What is the farmer to sell in the western part of the Tennassee Tennessee government, that he may be enabled to buy foreign articles? He lives at a great distance from sea; how is he to be provided with salt? IT is very remarkable, that the farmer has more use for salt in the western country, than in the Atlantic states. His cattle, in that country, will not thrive without salt; and this is the only thing, at present, he has occasion to give them. It has already been observed, that limestone abounds in the western country; this stone is not found in the southern states, until we approach the first ridge of mountains. As we travel westward, we find lead ore and salt springs in abundance. Does this country abound in articles that are seldom found in the Atlantic states, because it is composed of the original mother earth; whereas the land near the coast, in the middle and southern states, is adventitious? Be this as it may, the salt-springs that are found in every part of the western country, afford the utmost relief to the inhabitants, whose cattle, from the quality of their food, have more need of salt than those who are nearer the sea. Hitherto the salt-works have not been judiciously managed, either at Kentucky or the Cumberland settlement: and yet salt, made from the water of salt-springs, may be purchased for one dollar the bushel. As the source can never fail, and the mode of preparing it is capable of great improvement, we may reasonably suppose, that the average price of salt made on Cumberland river, will be three fourths of a dollar the bushel. THE settlers have not had much experience of bringing loaded boats up the Mississippi; but they calculate, from the trips they have made, that salt may be freighted from New-Orleans to Nashville, at rather less than three eights of a dollar the bushel; and it appears from similar experiments, that pork, flour, or other produce, may be taken from Nashville to New Orleans at less than"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/11"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9436/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/12","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Book] 1793, A Short Description of the Tennassee [Tennessee] Government : page 13"]},"width":1752,"height":3003,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9435~datastream~JP2/full/438,751/0/default.jpg","width":438,"height":751,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9435~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/12/page/tdh:9435","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/12/page/tdh:9435/656b69bfeb0fe","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9435~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":1752,"height":3003,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9435~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/12"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/12/annopage-12","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/12/annopage-12/annotation-12","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"13 three eights of a dollar the bushel. Those calculations regard the river Mississippi in its present state, with all its circular bendings, the banks covered with trees, and no part of the upper country settled; but the river, at present, is more than double the necessary length. From the mouth of the river Ohio to New-Orleans, the present distance by water is supposed to be 1000 miles; the direct distance is considerably short of 500 miles. In navigating that river we often find places like a horse-shoe, where we do not gain more than a mile by failing or rowing five miles. Every one of those bends may be cut off at a small expense. Let a common ditch, three or four feet deep, be dug across those necks of land, the roots being cut away when the river is low, and the next flood, by the rapidity of the stream through the short passage, will change the ditch to a navigable channel. An experiment of this kind has been made with success, at a place called Point Coupe . Two great benefits will arise from this process of giving the river a straight course; one half of the time and labour in ascending the river, will be saved by shortening the distance. This case supposes that vessels ascend the river by the help of oars, and poles, without sails, which is generally the case at present, because the river is so crooked, that no wind can be fair; but in case the chief bendings of the river should be cut off, as a southerly wind prevails there for the greater part of the year, every vessel would ascend by the use of sails, and the difficulties of that navigation would be reduced to a trifle. Considering what would be the utmost expense of transporting salt from New-Orleans to Nashville, and considering that Nashville is 2 or 300 miles by water farther from New-Orleans, than some other parts of the territory, and presuming that a great share of the present expense may be saved by practicable improvements in the navigation of the Mississippi, we may readily conclude, that the mere freight of the luxuries of life must be a small object to the inhabitants of that territory. As matters are now circumstanced, provided the navi gation navigation 14 of the Mississippi was free, the setters settlers on Cumberland river would take their produce to a shipping port, at less expense than it can be waggoned wagoned fifty miles in any country. As the country that has been described, is capable of producing, in great perfection, every article that grows in the Atlantic states, there are no leading circumstances, by which we can possibly determine, what is like to be the general course of its trade, or the particular articles in which its most valuable exports will consist. Iron, lead, pot-ash, pork, bacon, butter, cheese, corn, wheat, barley, flax, hemp, rice, indigo, and cotton, have all been mentioned by different persons from that country, as articles of export. Each of these articles will doubtless be exported in greater or less quantity, according to the demand; but it appears most probable, that the inhabitants will make their chief remittances in tobacco, hemp, rice, indigo, and cotton. The low grounds on the Mississippi must produce great crops of rice, and it has already been observed, that the high grounds near that river are particularly favourable favorable to the culture of indigo and cotton. The article last mentioned must be a constant source of wealth to the planter, because its value is considerable when compared with its weight, and it must be in constant demand in foreign markets. It is hardly necessary to observe, that in a country where timber of the best and most durable quality, and all other materials abound, necessary for shipping, the inhabitants will doubtless build ships for a distant market. EVERY thing that has been said concerning the advantages to be expected by people who settle in the Tennassee government, is founded on a supposition that all the country may be settled, and the inhabitants permitted to navigate the Mississippi. At present they are greatly restrained on both those heads; but there does not seem to be any violence offered to common sense, nor any great departure from probability, in supposing that the case will be materially altered within a few years.

Necessity is invincible, and a nation so well informed as the Spaniards must discover, that our fellow citizens on the western waters cannot remain quiet without the use of the Mississippi. The progress of population in that country is no more to be prevented or restrained than the flowing of the rivers. It cannot be retarded by laws, not by treaties, nor by a stronger cure- the fear of death. The proofs are recent and clear. There was not a single family settled in Kentucky before the year 1775 , and the first colony migrated to that country in the face of numerous and hostile savages, when they were more openly supported than of late years, by the British. It is known, that they have continued, from the beginning, in a constant state of war; and yet the settlement, at this hour, contains near one hundred thousand inhabitants. The first adventurers were men, and the increase for several years was chiefly occasioned by emigrants; but women are now become numerous, and the settlement begins to enjoy the benefit of a rapid increase from early marriage and constant emigration. This observation is also applicable to the settlers in the Tennassee Tennessee government; wherefore, it is a very moderate computation, that supposes four hundred thousand settlers on the western waters by the end of twenty years from this time. Are the inhabitants of such a country to be restrained from going to sea by means of a river that washes their land? Is the little colony of New-Orleans, by the help of a few soldiers, to sustain the weight of such a people, and prevent them from descending?

SUCH is the territory south of the Ohio. The eastern division, as we have observed, is composed of small mountains and vallies valleys , which are extended in the direction of the rivers. There is no plain, or tract of arable land, of any considerable width, in that settlement; but the vallies valleys are generally fertile. In the great western division, there is not a single eminence or ridge, that claims the name of a mountain. This country, nevertheless, is sufficiently diversified by rising ground, and bears no resemblance to the continued plain, which is found near the coast, in the middle and southern states.

There are two remarkable ridges or broken tracks, in that country of considerable di mensions dimensions , (19) which are not included in the above description; for they are stony or barren in many places, the first of those ridges divides the waters of Cumberland river from those of the Tennassee Tennessee ; it is broad as it approaches the foot of Cumberland mountain, or rather, diversified in that part by alternate hills and plains; but the plains, being chiefly without timber, are called barrens. The second remarkable tract of broken or barren land, begins near the mouth of Tennassee Tennessee , dividing the waters of that river from those of the Mississippi, and extending southerly towards the Chickasaw towns. The small rivers that run into the Mississippi, have their heads in this ridge. It is, in some parts, above twenty miles broad, rising at the very margin of the Tennassee Tennessee . It is covered with long grass, having little or no timber, except a small growth on the watercourses, which are numerous. THE territory west of Cumberland mountain has been stated at fifteen millions of acres; but this calculation leaves eight millions for the Holston settlement, which is certainly too much. The amount that may remain for sale on that side of the mountain, has, in round numbers, been stated at six millions; but the quantity, in all probability, will be considerably greater, without incident the great tract of vacant land south of the French Broad, nor the considerable tracts of arable land that are found in Cumberland mountain, nor those in the Cumberland barrens, so called, where the land, though without timber, is frequently very good; the Indians formerly, in burning the long grass, must have destroyed the trees. IT is probable, that all the lands to the northward of the great bend of the Tennassee Tennessee , may hereafter be joined to those ceded by North-Carolina, so as to form one state; such a state would have a natural boundary. And when we consider that the Creeks and Chactaws Choctaws live to the southward, who are numerous nations, together with the Chickasaws, we shall be apt to mark the latitude of the south bend, for a long series of years,"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/16"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9431/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/17","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Book] 1793, A Short Description of the Tennassee [Tennessee] Government : page 18"]},"width":1686,"height":2925,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9430~datastream~JP2/full/422,731/0/default.jpg","width":422,"height":731,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9430~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/17/page/tdh:9430","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/17/page/tdh:9430/656b69c57898b","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9430~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":1686,"height":2925,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9430~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/17"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/17/annopage-17","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9427/canvas/17/annopage-17/annotation-17","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"(20) as our southern boundary for the purpose of settlement. THE reader has been informed, that the soil, climate, and productions of the country on the western waters, are different from those in the Atlantic states; and it has been intimated, that the whole face of nature in that country bears a different appearance. Observations concerning things that are new or uncommon, should be made and received with caution; but the reader cannot fail to realize the narrative, if he takes the trouble of recollecting two or three remarkable facts, to which reference has already been had. IN the Atlantic states, the strata of lime-stone are broken, and inclined considerably to the horizon, being, at a medium, nearly parallel to the axis of the earth. In the western country, the strata are constantly found parallel to the horizon. IN the Atlantic states, salt springs are seldom or never found. In the western country, they abound in every part. IN the Atlantic states, pit-coal is very scarce, and is obtained with difficulty. In the western country, it is common, and frequently appears within a few feet of the surface. ONE of those countries must have suffered prodigious convulsions; the other may be supposed to retain more of its original form. Is it at all surprising, that a country, so different in its structure, its appearance, and essential qualities, should produce more plentiful crops, or that it should engage a considerable degree of public attention?
