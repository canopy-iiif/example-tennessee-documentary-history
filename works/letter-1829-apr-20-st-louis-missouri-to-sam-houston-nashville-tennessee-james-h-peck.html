Sir We have been informed that a youth whose name is Jacob Philipson lately from this place has been committed to the jail in nashville upon a charge of Larceny. Feeling considerable interest in the fate of this boy, on account of the respectability of his family, who reside here and with whom we are acquainted, we have taken the liberty of stating to you a few facts in relation to them, believing that you will give them such weight as they in your judgment may be entitled to, in deliberating upon the application; which we are about to make. Jacob Philipson is one of five children, who several years since had the misfortune to be deprived of their mother, the most valuable member of their family, and also their elder brother, a youth of much promise; about the same period a sudden reverse in the affairs of their father, together with an infermity infirmity under which he yet labours labors , left them to depend for support, mainly upon the exertions of their uncle Joseph Philipson , and who to derive the means of that support, in consequence of a like reverse of fortune, as compelled to become a teacher of music, an art which he originally acquired as an accomplishment merely. By the exertions of this uncle much care has been bestowed in the education of the children. For reasons unnecessary to be mentioned, those who had the guardianship of the youth in question, were induced too early to yield their consent to his inclination to leave home and to throw himself upon his own resources for support.

Although possessing very considerable talents for music he is otherwise of a weak understanding. It has occurred to us therefore, that his having embarked upon the world, without friends to admonish, at a period when most in need of admonition, perhaps destitute, and when his passions would have their greatest sway, and reason its least controul control , involve considerations which though unregarded by the law, may greatly mitigate the rigour rigor of the sentence, which society is disposed to pronounce on the aberation aberration from moral principle with which he stands charged and which for that cause properly and forcibly appeal to the seat of mercy. If the circumstances of the offence, (concerning which we profess entire ignorance) do not exclude the hope of reformation, we should think this more likely to be effected by the exertion of the prerogative of pardon in his favor, as far as to arrest the ignominious part of the punishment, that by subjecting him to to all the penalties of the law, while by such an intervention you would in no degree disarm the criminal law of its terrors.
