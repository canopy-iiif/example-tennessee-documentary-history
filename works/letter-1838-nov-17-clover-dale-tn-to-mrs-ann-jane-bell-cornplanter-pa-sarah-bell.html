November 17.th 1838 Dear Sister I have wished to write you before this, yet I put it off from day to day, thinking I had nothing to say that would interest you, but as William speaks of going to preaching in Charlotte to morrow tomorrow I thought I would take the oppertunity opportunity offered, and write you a few lines believing that a letter from us would afford you pleasure, if there was not much in it. When Margaret wrote you last I was very sick, it was the first time I ever wished to see Dr. Carter when I was sick; I was so very sick in two hours after I was first taken, that I was very willing he should be sent for, you know his manner of laughing and saying he expects you are only playing possom possum , but when he felt my pulse, he was candid and said I was very sick, the next time he came back I was much better he asked me if I had thought I was going to die, I said no for I did not think I should die then. But I have great cause to be thankful that I recovered so soon, for many that was taken sick about the same time, lingered much longer and some are since dead.
