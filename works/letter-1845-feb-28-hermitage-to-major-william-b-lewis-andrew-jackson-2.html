Your observations with regard to Mr. Buchannan Buchanan , are correct He shwd showed a want of moral courage in the affair of the intrigue of Adams Clay did not do me justice in the expose he then made and I am sure about that time did believe there was a perfect understanding between Adams Clay about the presidency the Secratary Secretary of State This I am sure of But whether Ive I have ceded that there was any corruption in the case or not I know not, but one thing I do know, that he wished me to combat them with thier their own weapons that was to let my friends say if I was elected I would make Mr. Clay Secretary of State This to me appeared deep corruption, I repelled at with that honest indignation, as I thought such corruption deserved!!

Common sense will at once shed the evil consequences that had ensue to Col Colonel Polk, to put himself in the attitude of favouring favoring Mr. Tyler for the succession It would split the democracy to pieces, and redound to the great injury of Polks administration I have from the moment I heard it put my face against it, hope I have checked this inconsiderate movement I hope there is no truth in the rumor if there is, there is less common sense in the movers than I calculated upon, let me hear from you. your sister Mrs. Leister , one of her daughters spent day before yesterday with us They all enjoy good health All my Houshold Household join me in the kindest salutations, yr your friend.
