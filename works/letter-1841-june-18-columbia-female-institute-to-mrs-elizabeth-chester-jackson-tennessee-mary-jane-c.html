Mama you do not know how happy I feel whenever I think about home. Tell Aunt and brother that I am looking very anxiously for them, I have just received a letter from Cousin Dick saying that I expect them on Friday week, but that will be one day too late for the Examination as Bishop Otey has persuaded Mr Smith to have three days examination instead of two — it will commence on that day (Friday week) and continue until Wednesday; so you see that will give us so much more time so display our knowledge. Please write me any how one more letter befor before I return. I shall offer no excuses for my short letter, as you know how much my time is occupied at present.
