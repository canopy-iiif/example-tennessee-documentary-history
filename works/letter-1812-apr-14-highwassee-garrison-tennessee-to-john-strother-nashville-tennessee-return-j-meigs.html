With respect to the salt Peter Cave at the mouth of Elk river on Dobleheads reserve /so called/ I will give you my view \u0026 conception of the rights claimed by the Cherokee s \u0026 by the Chickasaw s. Both these tribes have rights which have been admitted by the Government in their transactions with those people. The right to a very large tract of land including the P Reserve was by an early treaty with the Cherokees to wit, at the Hopewell treaty in 1785 \"allotted to the Cherokees for their hunting grounds\" see articles 4th \u0026 5th of that treaty. In 1794 9 years afterwards it appears that General Washington by an instrument which the Chickasaws call their parchment declared or it amounts to this. that the same land belonged to the Chickasaws. The Cherokees complain that this was done by an exparte representation of the Chickasaws. The Chickasaws also complain that the allotment in 1785 to the Cherokees the Commissioners were imposed on by an exparte Statement by the Cherokees then transactions perplexed the rights of both their tribes and it is probable that both tribes may be charged with exparte \u0026 unfair statements__ In order to remove their conflicting claims the Government bought in 1806 the Cherokee rights to the large tract in question. at the same time stipulating that the lands called Doubleheads reserve should be the Common property of the Cherokees then living on said reserve \u0026 two or three other Cherokees then named \u0026 consented to have the conflicting claims settled in such manner as will be equitable \u0026 just and will secure to the Cherokees the the title to the said Reservations\" plural/ because there was a reservation also for Melton \u0026 Hicks___"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8926/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8930/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8926/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1812 Apr. 14, Highwassee Garrison [Tennessee, to] John Strother, Nashville [Tennessee] / Return J.
