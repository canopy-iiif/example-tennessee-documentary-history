Colonel King's Iron-works, April 21st, 1797 . Dear Carey , I wished to have seen you, before I returned to Philadelphia ; but I am obliged to return to the session of Congress, which commences on the 15th of May . Among other things that I wished to have seen you about, was the business Captain Chesholm mentioned to the British Minister last winter at Philadelphia. I believe, but am not quite sure, that the plan then talked of will be attempted this fall; and if it is attempted, it will be in a much a larger way than then talked of; and if the Indians act their part, I have no doubt but it will succeed. A man of consequence has gone to England about the business, and if he makes arrangements as he expects, I shall myself have a hand in the business, and probably shall be at the head of the business on the part of the British.

Any power or consequence he gets will be against our plan. Perhaps Rogers, who has no office to lose, is the best man to give out talks against Hawkins. Read the letter to Rogers, and if you think it best to send it to him, put a wafer in it, and forward it to him by a safe hand, or perhaps you had best send for him to come to you, and speak to him yourself, respecting the state and prospect of things.

This sort of talk will be throwing all the blame off me, upon the late President, and as he is now out of office, it will be of no consequence how much the Indians blame him.

Your Committee are therefore fully persuaded that the original letter now produced was written and sent to Carey by Mr. Blount. They also find that this man Carey to whom it was addressed, is, to the knowledge of Mr. Blount, in the pay and employment of the United States, as their Interpreter to the Cherokee nation of Indians and an assistant in the public factory at Tellico Blockhouse.___ That Hawkins who is so often mentioned in this letter as a person who must be brought into suspicion among the Creeks, and if possible driven from his station, is the Superintendant of Indian affairs for the United States among the Southern Indians; Dinsmore is agent for the United States in the Cherokee nation; and Byers, one of the agents in the public factory at Tellico Blockhouse. The plan hinted at in this extraordinary letter to be executed under the auspices of the British, is so capable of different constructions and conjectures that your committee at present forbear giving any decided opinion respecting it; except that to Mr. Blount's own mind it appeared to be inconsistent with the interests of the United States and of Spain, and he was therefore anxious to conceal it from both.
