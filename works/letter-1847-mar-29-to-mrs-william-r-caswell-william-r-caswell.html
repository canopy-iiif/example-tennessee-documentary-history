In the letter, Caswell states that he is stationed near Vera Cruz and gives accounts of events going on in the war and with himself. He describes buildings in the area, some of which have been destroyed by bomb shells. Caswell expresses the mood of the men and his desire to come home, as well as describing the character of several other soldiers. Caswell concludes the letter by stating where his Regiment will be stationed next, and his opinion that the war is almost over.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1847-mar-29-to-mrs-william-r-caswell-william-r-caswell","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A167/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1847 Mar. 29 [to] Mrs. W[illia]m R.
