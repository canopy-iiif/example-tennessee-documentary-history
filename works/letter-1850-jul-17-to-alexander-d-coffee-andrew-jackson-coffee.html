When you first went to live at the plantation I thought ⁁ it a wise thing, and one that would benefit both parties, but I not long after that event changed my opinion, especially as to the benefit to accrue to yourself, and would have freely advised you on the subject, but for two reasons. One was my own unsuccessfull unsuccessful career up to that time, and the other, the Coolness that grew up about that time between us. I am convinced that you would have done better on your own hook, and you would have been saved much anxiety \u0026c et cetera Well it is now over and you have embarked in an interesting and safe business; with industrious and rising men, and I have no doubt you will be very successfull successful"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8713/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8717/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8713/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1850 Jul. 17 [to] Alex[ander D.
