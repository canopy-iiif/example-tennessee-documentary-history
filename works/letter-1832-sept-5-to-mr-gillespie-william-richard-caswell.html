Great interest and excitement is manifested by almost every person in the election. Mr. Foster , is engaged every moment of his time in electioneering, and requested me to write to you. He says that McFarland he thinks will vote for him, but he fears that Mr. Fain \u0026 Colo. Colonel Brazelton will make him (Mc F.) render a rigid account to his constituents for his vote. Mr Foster says that you can do something with Mr. Fain \u0026 Colo. Colonel Brazelton, to relieve Mr. McFarland from this embarrassment; I have written a short letter, to Mr. Fain, but you will see him, and can talk to him upon the subject. I find that the papers you sent to Mr. F. have been filed in the Secretary's office, but McGraw has neglected to send the papers, which he promised to do. The secretary says that I can file them at my leisure. I will write to Maj.
