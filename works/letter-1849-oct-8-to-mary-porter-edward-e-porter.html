I have had six hard studies — besides French — And all of the Societys duties to attend to \u0026 also those of the sons of Temperance. I had the Salutatory address to deliver before society at her first meeting, and have also had to lead in all the debates Since it began; and also hold a troublesome office in the S Sons of temperance.

Oh if you only knew how happy your letter made me when I read it, you would have some idea of a Brothers love. Can you imagine any happier scene, than to see two to whom God hath united by the ties which bind a Brothers \u0026 Sister — placing mutual confidence in each other, and seeming to live, only that each may be a help \u0026 comfort to the other? Let us both unite and form such a Scene as this I have represented. At the present time I am earnestly considering what Profession I will choose, to which I will devote the remainder of my life. At one time the Law with its honors \u0026 profits recurs to my mind as being the most Suitable; Again the Ministry With its responsibilities, \u0026 reward hereafter forces itself upon my mind; And while weighing the \"why \u0026 the why fore\" on both sides, another thought comes home with triple force: the thought that I should be a missionary. There is a field here opens itself, which is extensive \u0026 Grand almost beyond comprehension. Survey it on every side! Consider that within its boundaries, six hundred millions of souls are embraced, All of whom if we must believe the scriptures, will be irrecoverably lost, if they do not embrace Christ as he is freely offered to him in the gospel. Methinks I hear the Macedonian \"Cry come over and help us.\" But who will go? Every one shrinks from the labors \u0026 dangers attending on being a missionary; And can point out some neighbors or friend, whose duty it is undoubtedly to go. Thus each trys tries to throw off the responsibility, upon another; And all doing this, no one will be found to go. But shall I go?

In conclusion of this subject Remember me to both of them; And as you are all thrown together, persuing pursuing the same studies: be kind and affectionate to one another; And you should try to find out one anothers good qualities ; not faults . And above all Mary, be respectfull respectful to your teachers ; And although you may not like them now, but consider them tyranical tyrannical — a little —; yet remember you are now moulding your mind, for usefulness hereafter; not only in this world, but in the world to come. I have no doubt, but that, in after years, we will look back to the present time, with feelings of thankfulness to those, who are now conducting us through the crooked labyrinths of science; and will also experience feelings of regret that we have wasted so many precious hours, And let slip so many opportunities of improvement.
