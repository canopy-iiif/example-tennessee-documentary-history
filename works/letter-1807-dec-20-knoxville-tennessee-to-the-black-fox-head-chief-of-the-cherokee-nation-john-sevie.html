Sevier also expresses his resentment and distrust for the Creek Nation, and he condemns the Cherokee for allowing Creeks to pass through and settle in their nation. Sevier encourages Black Fox not to let the Creek settle on their land since they rob and murder both the Cherokee and the white people in the area. He also adds that there have been complaints that some Cherokees have robbed and threatened white settlers in the area, and he requests that they be punished and compensate the white settlers.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1807-dec-20-knoxville-tennessee-to-the-black-fox-head-chief-of-the-cherokee-nation-john-sevie","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7007/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1807 Dec. 20, Knoxville, [Tennessee], to the Black Fox head Chief of the Cherokee Nation / John Sevier"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1807-dec-20-knoxville-tennessee-to-the-black-fox-head-chief-of-the-cherokee-nation-john-sevie"},"buildId":"GoibdBG8wZ0BV9iTI83rS","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
