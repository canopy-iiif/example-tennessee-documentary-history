Tennesseee At the age of twenty-three he volunteered in the Creek war, and later was with Jackson at Pensacola and at New Orleans . 1835 - 1836 he represented Smith and Sumner Counties in the State Senate. William Trousdale was in the Mexican war and was twice wounded at the battle of Chapultepec . For gallant service in this battle he was made Brigadier-General by Brevet in the United States army. 1849 he was nominated by the Democrats for Governor; his Whig opponent being Neil S. Brown . The campaign was one of the most spirited in the history of the State. Trousdale was elected by a vote of 61,740 to 60,350. During his term of office Ex-President Polk died in Nashville . The legislation of this period is uninteresting. Politics was the order of the day. At the close of Governor Trousdale's term he was again a candidate but was defeated by the Whigs with William B. Campbell . The vote stood for Campbell 63,333, for Trousdale 61,673. After his defeat he was appointed Minister to Brazil .
