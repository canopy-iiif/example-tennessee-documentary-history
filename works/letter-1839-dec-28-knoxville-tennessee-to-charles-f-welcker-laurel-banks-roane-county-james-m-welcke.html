There is now and has been during a week or two past a lot of the Durham stock in town. They were brought here by Mr. Daugherty from Kentucky . _ If I do not speak publickly publicly , I would say there is very little of the genuine stock in his lot of some 20 or 25._ For some he asks 3 and 4 hundred dollars; but they are greatly inferior to any one of yours. Some he has sold for 2 and 3 hundred dollars already I do not believe, in fact, I know, I would not give your four for the whole lot._ On yesterday I saw Mr. Heiskel 's Bull for which he gave one thousand dollars._ His is a very fine animal._ But in my opinion he is not superior in any respect to Hanibal_ he is larger it is true; but Hanibal if treated as he should be will be as large or large and I think he excells excels Heiskel's in one or two very important parts. You should have him curried regularly and if you would have the hair on his head and neck kept strait straight and smooth it would make a wonderful difference in his countenance.
