Sister please anser answer this letter as soon as you receive it, it would releive relieve my mind to see that you have not forgotten me. You cannot imagine ⁁ how much disappointed I was to hear that Aunt Narcissa was not comming coming up to see me, but I was as much delighted to hear that Papa was coming up. I wondor wonder how I shall spend my Christmas the first one that I ever spent from home. You will all be so happy at home the very name of home makes me feel happy. I never knew how much I loved you all until I left home. There is no place like home according to my oppinion opinion .
