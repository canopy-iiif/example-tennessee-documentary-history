I have now in or about collected them all, and can have them ready to send to Nashville at any time. I am informed that the first stand of arms brot brought to this co county was 22 or 3 years since__ They were drawn for the use of a volunteer company, and used by them, some 6 years; at the expiration of which time, the company and muskets were pretty well wornout The captain who commanded the company has been since lied, and but few of the Co. Company Now remain in this county The 2nd stand of Arms but to this county was in 1837 or 8_ They were brought to this County, for the use of another volunteer Company which was organizing here__ Ex_ Gov. Cannon was then in this place, and authorized the Company to send to Nashville and yet a stand of Arms which was done. About that time, the Texas was Commenced, and some of the Company left for the seat of war, Camping with them some 8 or 10 of the Muskets__ and I have been in formed that they used them to a great advantage in massacreeing massacring the Mexicans. The first stand of Musket are nearly all worn out or lost. The last stand is in a tolerable fair condition considering what they have been through. I had them in my possession, or partly so, until the presidential Election in 1844 when I gave them up to the Democrats, and they were used by them during the Presidential Canvass of that year.
