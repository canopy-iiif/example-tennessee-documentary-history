Perhaps we have in Tennessee as ‚ÅÅ bright nights as they are here, but there we have not often more than two or three such nights in succession, whilst here they are seldom obscured by a single cloud. As my comrade Winship (who has recovered from the measles and this evening returned to our Quarters) would say I am writing by moonlight for \" grandour grandeur \"‚Äî for indeed I can see much better by candle light than by moonshine, bright and beautiful as it is. I have just heard to-day, that our Cavalry Regiment had reached San Antonio, ‚Äî that supplies could not be had for them to recruit at that place‚Äîand that Gen. General Wool had ordered them to Port Lavaca, which by reference to the map you will see is a long ways behind the Head Quarters of the Army, and I doubt if ever they can get up with their horses in condition to render any service‚Äî Genl. General Pillows Brigade is now moving forward, and we shall probably go ourselves next week to Monterey ‚Äî I am anxious to go up, not only because of the great battle fought there‚Äî and of the advanced position we shall be placed in, but because too, the country is described as most abundantly supplied with grain, cattle, fruits, \u0026c and et cetera (none of which we get here) but it is said to be a most salubrious and delightful climate‚Äî I have heard very little more more of the particulars and incidents of the battle than I had heard when I wrote to you last‚ÄîI have not yet heard what Bob Foster done there, but having a list of the officers who were killed and wounded in the storming of Monterey ( tho' though not of a single private) and his name is not on that list‚Äî I know however that he has done, and behaved well. for even the Regular officers say the Tennesseeans Tennesseans , all, fought like Trojans‚Äî"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/118/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:122/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/118/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1846 Oct. 2 [to] Mrs. Elizabeth Caswell / William R.
