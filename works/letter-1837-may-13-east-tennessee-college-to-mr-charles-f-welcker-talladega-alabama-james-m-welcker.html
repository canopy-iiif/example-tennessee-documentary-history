A few days past Father sent us your letter of March the 31; In regard to which, I have truly to say, that no inteligence intelligence , ever reached us, from you, from which we derived so little pleasure. To hear that any of you is well, is indeed, to us, at all times the greatest satisfaction; but to hear of your distresses of sickness and death is equally grievous. And I have only to state that they do not reside upon you alone, but are mutual; Further more they are such as none can change or amend.
