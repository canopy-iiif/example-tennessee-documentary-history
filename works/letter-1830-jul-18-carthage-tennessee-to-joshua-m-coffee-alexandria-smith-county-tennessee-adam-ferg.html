I would here remark that I think the idea is premature and as far as my enquiries go the present clerk will be Sustained in office at least the peace of Smith County would require it. I would further remark that I would no means insinuate any thing as respectful to the present Clerk on the contrary I would like to see him Sustained Remain as he is But should it prove otherwise and a new clerk is to be elected, you with the rest of your the fellow Justices will be called upon in your official capacity to make a Suitable choice to fill his place. In doing this Your Judgement will be exercised to make a Suitable choice Judge of the deliver on the qualifications of those who may be candidates. Among those who will offer their pretentions pretensions for that High and respectable office I hold myself as one.
