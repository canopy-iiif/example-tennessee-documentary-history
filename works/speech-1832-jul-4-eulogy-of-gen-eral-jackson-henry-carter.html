It is very fashionable, \u0026 long has been the custom for every age, and nation, to immortalize those patriot heroes, who have lived in different ages of the World, \u0026 to rehearse their names and deeds, until they have become a living motto, indelibly imprinted upon the hearts of all. That long list of worthy ancestors, who have, and are now exerting their powers and resources for the happiness and prosperity of our great Republick Republic , are richly deserving the warmest pra ⁁ i ses of this free people. But in the list of worthies so often repeated, there is one, who, has received but a faint share of our encomium; and that is, the present Chief Magistrate of our Country. View his noble career thus far of his life as a philanthropist — gaze but for a moment at the sublime and almost unparalel unparalleled scene of New Orleans — meditate but for a moment more the humane \u0026 benevolent feeling that he manifested towards the Seminole Indians , when he was sent to quell that tribe, where it is well known he not only executed many of them without Judge or Jury, but, even one or two foreigners, who were then trading among the Indians — \u0026 last of all, consider him, as one of those dareing daring , noble, illustrious, renowned, patriotic, benevolent, \u0026 humane Statesmen, who has far surpassed the wisest \u0026 best of his predecessors, yea, even the immortal Washington himself, in one particular thing for which his mind seems peculiarly adapted — that is, fighting duels — when I say, we behold all their excellencies combined in this great man what American heart is there, so cold to all the finer feelings of which our nature is susceptible, that would not burst forth with spontaneous ejaculations of praise, for such a worthy!!! Yet notwithstanding the many excellencies of this great \u0026 good man, his character is slandered at an an an unknown rate, \u0026 that he by some of our most worthy citizens! I will just relate an anecdote, which will show in some degree, what the feelings of many are towards him. Two men having met in a City not far hence, (one a friend \u0026 the other an opposer of Gen General Jackson) turned their conversation to polytical political affairs. The opposer asks; on what ground, do your party claim that Jackson has a right to the seat he now occupies? Why says the Jacksonian, the reason is very obvious. The glorious victory of New Orleans is sufficient to merit this high station. The opposer then says — In the time that the Roman Empire was enjoying its happiest days, the City of Rome was at one time saved from distinction, by means of a flock of Geese, \u0026 they never thought of put ⁁ t ing the Gander in president for life!! Any one can see, that this anecdote is calculated to carry the idea, that, this victory was more of a hit than any good wit. But after all the jokes that men can invent, (for it does not seem possible they could speak thus in earnest) we must allow this to be a complete, decided victory. I have always had the impression, that the decision of this Battle, was owing in a great measure, to the assistance which the americans Americans received from the immense number of"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9475/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Speech] 1832 Jul. 4 Eulogy of Gen [eral] Jackson / Henry Carter : page 2"]},"width":3235,"height":5104,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9474~datastream~JP2/full/404,638/0/default.jpg","width":404,"height":638,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9474~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/1/page/tdh:9474","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/1/page/tdh:9474/656b69ce1b20e","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9474~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3235,"height":5104,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9474~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9473/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"bales of Cotton, which were then at hand, which they placed before them as a breast-work, to screen themselves from the enemies shot.
