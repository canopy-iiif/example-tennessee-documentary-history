To be honest and candid, I do regret that General Jackson joined the Church when he did and as he did yet, I may be altogether mistaken. On this subject I have you to judge when you read what follows. When General Jackson returned from Washington his neice niece the wife of General Donnelson Donelson brother of the Mayor and daughter of Governor Branch advised him to send for me to preach for them at the Hermitage (Mrs D Donelson is a Cumberland professed under my own menestry ministry and is by far the most intelligent Lady of the whole convention ) accordingly I went. preached every two weeks best mannered \u0026 full and was very intimate with the family of the General.
