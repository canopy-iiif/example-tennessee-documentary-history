Sevier also enclosed a letter he had written to Cherokee chiefs.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1797-jan-12-knoxville-tennessee-to-silas-dinsmore-governor-john-sevier-governor-of-the-state-","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7176/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1797 Jan. 12, Knoxville, [Tennessee to] Silas Dinsmore / Governor John Sevier, Governor of the state of Tennessee: a machine-readable transcription of an image"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1797-jan-12-knoxville-tennessee-to-silas-dinsmore-governor-john-sevier-governor-of-the-state-"},"buildId":"IQCZ0oVD0hJs59bVvYwiE","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
