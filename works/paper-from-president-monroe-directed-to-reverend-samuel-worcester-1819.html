But it will be indispensable in order to apply any portion of the sum appropriated in the manner proposed, that the plan of Education in addition to reading, writing arithmetic, should, in the i n struction of the Boys, extend to the practical knowledge of the mode of agriculture, of such of the mechanic arts as are suited to the condition of the Indians; and in that of the girls, to spinning, weaving sewing. It is also indispensable that the Establishment should be fixed within the limits of those Indian nations, which border on our settlements.
