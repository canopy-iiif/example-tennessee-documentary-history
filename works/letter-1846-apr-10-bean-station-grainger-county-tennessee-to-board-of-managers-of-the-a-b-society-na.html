The frinds friends collected were left with the Treasurer until he could obtain more. I think the Society will gradually increase and do much good. From that neighbourhood I went to Beans Station , via Rutledge, where I spent two days, preached on Saturday and Sabbath I formed a small Bible Society containing some about fifty members, some fifteen of whom are coloured colored people, who take a deep interest in the cause, paying $3.00 of what was collected.

This Society is designed to supply with Bibles Testerments Testaments a poor destitute section which lies between the Chucky and French Broad rivers , north of the Paint Mountain . They have a great work to perform; with small means.

I made arrangements to have most of these sold in Scott and Lee Counties, by several responsible individuals, who will cheerfully serve the good cause without charge From these parts I returned and passed through Kingsport , and was glad to find that the Society there had received their books and were doing well.
