Sanford , accompanied with a notice from him, that I should become liable to arrest, if after ten days, I should still be found residing within the unsettled limits of the state. I am under obligation to your excellency for the information, which I believe I am justified in deriving by inference from your letter, that it is through your influence, that I am about to be removed from the office of postmaster at this place; inasmuch that it gives me the satisfaction of knowing that I am not removed on the ground of any real or supposed unfaithfulness in the performance of the duties of that office. Your excellency is pleased to intimate that I have been guilty of a criminal opposition to the humane policy of the general government. I cannot suppose that your excellency refers to those efforts for the advancement of the Indians in knowledge, and in the arts of civilized life, which the general government has pursued ever since the days of Washington , because I am sure that no person can have so entirely misrepresented the course which I have pursued during my residence with the Cherokee people.

Worcester, Christian missionary living in the Cherokee Nation, to Georgia Governor George R. Gilmer in response to a letter Worcester received from Gilmer. Worcester received Gilmer's letter through Colonel Sanford and is informed by Sanford that he is liable to arrest if he has not removed within ten days. Worcester defends himself against accusations made by the governor, contending that his goal is to stimulate the spiritual growth of the Cherokee people and not to revolt politically against the state. He explains why he cannot in good conscience take the oath of Georgia and describes his progress in translating Christian texts into Cherokee. Worcester is determined to remain with the Cherokee until he is forced to move. Elias Boudinot, editor of the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper is mentioned.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1831-june-10-new-echota-cherokee-nation-to-george-r-gilmer-governor-of-georgia-samuel-a-worce","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A631/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter], 1831 June 10, New Echota, Cher[okee] Na[tion] to George R.
