So I will take it for granted that all are well and thriving I have no news to write of much interest. I am happy to state that we are all in excellent health. Bettie , myself the children and the Servants. I suppose you are very busy with your work \u0026c et cetera I hope I may be able to pay you a visit before very long when I will take much pleasure in visiting your butter biscuit and before a great while I suppose you will be visiting this notable city. If so I shall be most happy to entertain you during your visit and I will try to show you all the sights of the city. I see from a late law of Congress that there will be some \"Bounty Land\" coming to Ma for Pas Services in the Creek war of 1812 and the British war of 1814 \u0026 1815. As soon as I am certain the terms of the laws \u0026c et cetera I will prepare papers and so forth for the purpose of establishing the claims I will be worth some thing — Will you be so kind as to call on Jno John Simpson \u0026 Co Company and ascertain what has become of the notes I left in his hands for collection of Robt Robert and Wm William Warren has any money been collected or is there likely to be any. I have not heard a word from them and do not know what their position may be. One note was due 1 July 1849 the other 1 Jany January 1850 both amt amount $166.66 making $333.33 — Give our love to Ann , to Ma, Rachel , Cate , William , Joshua , and Andrew and our regards to all friends and accept the same for your self Your Brother Andrew J.
