On my first arrival in the Territory, I much confess that I was not very well pleased with the country; in consequence of the scarcity of timber. The land in the neighbourhood neighborhood of St Louis lies very handsomely \u0026 is quite rich, but in many places there are extensive tracts of country of entire meadow; without a solitary stick of timber__ yet to compensate for the want of timber, coal mines are abundant. As I proceeded on up the Missouri , I became more \u0026 more pleased; until in fine, I have gotten to a Country, where I feel willing to stop; as I never expect to find a better. The land in the neighbourhood of this place, is beautifully situated \u0026 well timbered to a great distance . The soil is of the best quality \u0026 generally well watered__ the atmosphere pure \u0026 healthfull healthful . Every vegitable vegetable that is known to flourish in so northern a latitude, may be cultivated to advantage here. It is perhaps one of the best Countries, for the growth of wheat, that the eye of man ever beheld__ tobacco grows luxuriantly. More corn has been raised to the acre here (if my information be correct,) than can be raised in any part of west Tennessee _ Rye, oats, barley, buck-wheat, turnips, potatoes, \u0026c etcetera are raised in great perfection. Cotton grows much better than could be expected, in a climate so far north; yeh it is said to be rather a precarious crop. The Missouri bottoms are mostly alluvion, or in other words made land; the soil from eight to ten feet deep_ the mean width, from three to four miles.

The woods \u0026 natural meadows are covered of all seasons with grass as high as a mans head; so that stock require no other food, except it is hogs \u0026 there is always a sufficiency of most to keep them fat_ salt springs abound throughout the Territory; so that they require no salt.

McGavock - Untitled","description":"This is a letter to John Overton from R. McGavock, dated November 25, 1818. McGavock has just found a place in the territory on the Missouri River in which to settle. He describes in great detail how good the alluvial land is for growing crops. McGavock describes the local wild foliage. McGavock writes that it is also perfect for livestock as there are many grassy meadows. He believes that the area will have a greater population than Tennessee because the farm land is so fertile. McGavock offers to act as agent to Overton and any others who want to invest in land in the territory.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/1818-nov-25-franklin-tennessee-to-john-overton-nashville-tennessee-r-mcgavock","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A8254/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"1818 Nov. 25, Franklin, Tennessee [to] John Overton, Nashville, Tennessee / R.
