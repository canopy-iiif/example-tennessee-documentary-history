In calling upon me as the only one capable of carrying out a measure of which I am forbidden by the Cherokee people to make any recognition in their name, one point appears to have been strangely forgotten: It appears to have been forgotten that when unauthorized individuals were substitute for me and for my colleagues in by the United States ' agents, for the purpose of giving form to the measure in question, those agents represented me as a mere usurper of power, and only the head of a small and worthless faction. They said they had made a treaty which the people would fulfil fulfill , because it was the people's work and accomplished by a national and triumph over my intrigues. My course has been a steady one It will so continue. Disregarding every effort to discredit me at home and abroad, I have unwaveringly conformed to the wishes of the Cherokees . I need not here recapitulate what those wishes have been, what they are.

I am willing, if our instructions from the Cherokee people not , on any conditions, to assent to their exile, are placed beyond all chance of being fulfilled; even to assume the responsibility in such conditions as the necessity of our situation might enable us to agree upon with the Executive of negotiating an arrangement upon conditions growing out of the necessity of our situation; and to take the risk off their indignation ,- rather than see the instrument against which the people have protested, made pretext for enforcement by the sword; but I should and deserve scorn, could I ever be decryed decried , through promises or threats, by any act of mine to bind my people my nation to what they have so often and so solemnly disavowed.
