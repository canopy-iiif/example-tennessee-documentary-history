Indeed the zeal and talent arraged arranged here on the 4th in favor of the enterprize were of a character sufficient to accomplish any thing almost which was not wholly impracticable I request that your official engagements would not permit you to participate in the deliberations of the Convention__ I have no doubt you would have been highly delighted with the harmony and liberal spirit and feeling which was manifested throughout the meeting I am with sentiments of the highest respect your obt. svt obedient servant .
