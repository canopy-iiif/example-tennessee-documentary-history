If it were answered, I would wish to enquire at the Mad,, of the Synod; (as they are great sticklers for decipline discipline ) How often an an an offending Brother; or Presbytery, ought to be sighted, before a Synod, Presb Presbyterian or Session; could adjudicate on their case And how often Mcadow , King , and yourself had been regularly summoned to appear, and before What P,, Preacher They say that you, \u0026 King never had any authority; if so, how did they know it?

Barnett writes about the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and its various members. He is concerned about the legitimacy of some of the preachers. He writes about some pamphlets that the old style Presbyterians have been circulating that are slanderous to the new style, Cumberland Presbyterians. Barnett plans to propose a formal split between the Cumberlands and other Presbyterians at the next synod, and asks for Ewing's support. He mentions a possible move to Forked Deer. Barnett also writes that he and others want Ewing to write a history about the origins of the Cumberland Presbyterians. Many people have been expressing curiosity, but cannot find information them because Buck's Theological Dictionary is out of print.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/1823-june-4-henderson-county-kentucky-to-finis-ewing-boonville-missouri-william-barnett","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A5622/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"1823 June 4, Henderson County, K[entuck]y [to] Finis Ewing, Boonville, Missouri / W[illia]m Barnett"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"1823-june-4-henderson-county-kentucky-to-finis-ewing-boonville-missouri-william-barnett"},"buildId":"xpOqSKtXe5nioP5W4wpQX","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
