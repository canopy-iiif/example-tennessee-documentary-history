This is only for my own information and if there is any proof warranted I want to know what it is in order that as may be taking it as we may be redy ready for trial at the may term. we want the case brought to a close as soon as possible. we have lerned learned that Col Colonel Hendrson has again hired out the negroes for the present year. and sold the land \u0026 we also have learned that the suit against Driver in the Louisiana circuit court was tried and judgement went against Driver for some 7 or 8 $ which is not more than half the value of the negores sued for, but we learn that Henderson has got the negroes for the judgement. if he has don done that it will do. but I do not know how what is in your last letter you wrote that the suit had not been tried but shortly we learn by a letter from Henderson to John Reynolds that it had been tried so we imagine you was mistaken I wish you to pay some Little attention to the way Henderson is hiring the negroes.\u0026 see what he has done with Ours negores. Write me fully on receipt of this what has been done. Tubb \u0026 Reynolds is very anxious, to hear. \u0026 whether it is necessary for any of us to come out. \u0026 see it any thing in person that we ought to attend to.
