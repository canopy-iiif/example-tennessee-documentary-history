Genl General Scott has arrested Genls Generals Worth and Pillow for disrespect and also some junior officers have become involved in the same snare . It is a disgrace all around, a disgrace to Genl General Scott for the manner in which he made the arrests \u0026 a disgrace to the officers for the matter of the arrest and I see by the Washington Correspondent of the \"Picayune\" that it has been decided to recall the whole of them and place either Genl General Taylor or Butler in command. I hope it may be so \u0026 that those officers implicated may all be dismissed the Service. The people who write from Mexico talk about peace but I do not know what new ground they have to stand on. I am fearfull fearful that it will be many years before we have peace again, but still I do not despair, the Anti war speeches of such men a Calhoun \u0026 Crittenden are extensively republished in Mexico and do an immencity immensity of harm in misleading the Mexican people as to the real sentiment in this"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8734/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1848 Jan. 15 New Orleans, [to] Alex[ander D Coffee] / Andrew J[ackson] Coffee : page 2"]},"width":3131,"height":3858,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2/full/391,482/0/default.jpg","width":391,"height":482,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/page/tdh:8733","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/page/tdh:8733/656b68f5c2306","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3131,"height":3858,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"country towards them.
