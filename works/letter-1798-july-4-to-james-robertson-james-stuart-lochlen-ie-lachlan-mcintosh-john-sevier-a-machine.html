Sevier stated that he appointed the agents to represent the interests of the state of Tennessee on the issues of a treaty to be made between the United States and the Cherokee. Among the issues Sevier noted for the three men to pay close attention to were the Indian boundary lines and the state districts in close contact with those boundaries. Sevier also commanded the men to examine the grounds of the Cherokee, to question the constitutionality of Cherokee land claims whenever possible, and to try to get more roads, rivers, and ports in the possession of the state.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1798-july-4-to-james-robertson-james-stuart-lochlen-ie-lachlan-mcintosh-john-sevier-a-machine","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7061/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1798 July 4, [to] James Robertson, James Stuart, Lochlen [i.e. Lachlan] McIntosh / John Sevier : a machine-readable transcription of an image"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1798-july-4-to-james-robertson-james-stuart-lochlen-ie-lachlan-mcintosh-john-sevier-a-machine"},"buildId":"xpOqSKtXe5nioP5W4wpQX","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
