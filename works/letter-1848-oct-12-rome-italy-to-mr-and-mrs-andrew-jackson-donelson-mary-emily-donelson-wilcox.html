October 1848 My dear Ma and Pa, We arrived on last sunday evening in this eternal city, famed as the former mistress of the world \u0026 consecrated by the glorious deeds of its warriors, its antiquity, \u0026 the numerous monuments of art that still repose within its walls. Since then we have been busy visiting its curiosities \u0026 have seen the Pantheon , the former temple of heathen divinities, the Coliseum , where romans once met to witness the exploits of their gladiators \u0026 where the earlier christians suffered martyrdom for their cross \u0026 bible; the roman forum, covered with the ruins of temple \u0026 triumphal arches; the capitol, built on the site of the one, where roman senators once met to frame laws for the world \u0026 where Cesar Caesar , triumphant o'er his countrys foes, died by the hand of this friend. We have stood on the spot where the sacred fire of the vestals once burnt, walked o'er the ground where Cicero delivered his famous oration, visited the prison where Saints Paul and Peter were imprisoned \u0026 seen the spring that burst from the earth for them to baptize the converted gaolers jailers . There are 366 churches in the town, each one is worthy of observation \u0026 many are models of architecture \u0026 magnificence. The St. Peter , the noblest of christian temples, is a dowry of itself. Numerous artists of genius have enriched the many museums here \u0026 contributed to render them the most superior in the world. The antique statues \u0026 paintings, that have served as guides to modern artists are preserved in them \u0026 give them an interest possessed by few other museums. At present Rome is a perfect paradise, the whole day is like a spring morning in Tennessee , there is a continual breeze, \u0026 the orange, lemon, fig, olive \u0026 palm trees are in all their glory.

They have grapes, pears, oranges, figs, apples, chessnuts \u0026 flowers here all the year, never see snow, \u0026 have perpetual verdure. One never hears of war, or revolution, \u0026 indeed I believe one half of the population of southern Italy is unaware of the war in Lombardy . The pope is rather unpopular. We were 10 days in Naples . It is a beautiful, tho' noisy city, \u0026 the most thickly inhabited place I ever saw, there are 40—000 lazzaroni in the town — a set of people whose profession is stealing \u0026 begging, who sleep in the streets, eat nothing but maccaroni macaroni \u0026 watch like foxes strangers' pockets. It is almost impossible to walk in the streets \u0026 very dangerous to carry a purse, handkercheif handkerchief , or anything else in one's pocket. The king is a prisoner in his own palace \u0026 does not dare to step out, as his life has been threatened. I would not be in his place for all the crowns in christendom. He is said to be a very good \u0026 pious man \u0026 not the rascal we imagine him to be in Germany \u0026 the United States . Mr. Rowan , our minister there, was I exceedingly kind to us \u0026 contributed much to render our stay agreeable. We found him on our arrival in the lazaretto, a place where persons coming from suspected places are detained for a fortnight. He had been to Palermo to see our consul who was wearing the rebel badge \u0026 had recognized the revolution in Sicily , \u0026 on his return was put into the lazaretto, because the Cholera was said to be in Palermo. His family were in a great rage \u0026 made such a fuss that they were obliged to let him out. We visited Herculaneum \u0026 Pompei — two of the most striking examples of the mutability of earthly things —, their ruins testify to their former splendor, \u0026 I almost wept when I sat on the fallen pillars that once supported their temples \u0026 thought beneath me two once powerful cities lay entombed.

The lava was so hot as to burn out feet through our shoes, I smoke was issuing from every crevice \u0026 scenting the air with sulphur, we heard the fire boiling as in a furnace around \u0026 beneath us \u0026 saw the stream of red hot lava burst as a spring from a rock from the earth \u0026 pour down the side of the mountain. We could not go to the edge of the crater, because it was throwing out too many rocks. The descent was a regular slide with the sand above our eyes knees \u0026 stones, sand \u0026 fine lava pelting our heads \u0026 backs. From the summit we had a noble view of the numberless villages \u0026 beautiful country around, of the sea with its many green islets \u0026 the lovely bays of Naples, Sorrentum \u0026 Salerno , the desolate sides of Vesuvius, where not a leaf of green waves contrasted well with the luxuriant valley beneath with its orange, lemon, fig \u0026 olive trees, all laden with fruit, \u0026 the silent ruins of Herculaneum \u0026 Pompei well with the gay \u0026 bustling city of Naples.

Thus in the short space of a month we have visited the regions of eternal fire \u0026 eternal ice. We were 8 days in Florence .

Turin is another neat, pretty place, \u0026 indeed all the italian towns are handsome, the streets are generally wide, well paved \u0026 clean, the houses are tastefully built \u0026 then the many palaces, gardens, curious fountains, statues, splendid churches, altars consecrated to the virgin, temples \u0026 monuments in ruin give them a romantic appearance. One can have no idea ere visiting Italy of the splendor of its churches, they exceed the most extravagant descriptions of travellers \u0026 speak well for the devotion of catholics.

The italian women are very handsome \u0026 graceful, \u0026 the men very fine looking, tho' fond of ease \u0026 pleasure. We have made rather three trips on the mediterranean , once we had very bad stormy weather \u0026 were very sick, but the two other times the sea was calm \u0026 we enjoyed ourselves very much. The diligences \u0026 steamboats do not start as regularly now as they did in more peaceful times \u0026 hence we have been detained a great deal on the road. We have been as buy as bees in summer \u0026 been on the wing generally from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening when we dine. Sister is as well as well can be \u0026 has enjoyed herself very much. Brother has become quite witty \u0026 keeps Sister a laughing half of the time. I hope Johnny has left Berlin ere this, for I have been very uneasy about him. We received your letter addressed to Naples \u0026 those addressed to Rome \u0026 will try to join you as soon as possible. I wish you could spend this winter in Italy, far from the revolutions \u0026 the cold wind of the north. You would not regret, I am sure, the change. Sister \u0026 Brother join in love to you, Johnny \u0026 the children. We are very grateful to you for allowing us to take this trip \u0026 have endeavored to show our gratitude by taking advantage of the instruction the antiquities of this country afford. Kiss Martin \u0026 Daniel for me \u0026 believe me Your devoted daughter Mary P.S Post Script . Remember me affectionately to Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fag , should they be in Frankfurt . M.
