I can assure you that it was received with great pleasure, as your letters always are, but I must confess this last with more than usual, I was also a little astonished for I had began to suspect that you all thought it of no consequence whether I heard from home or not; I am very glad to see that I was mistaken but you must remember that you promised to write me at least once in two weeks. and Papa always tell me something about the dear Children, for I am almost distracted to see them. I awake very often in the night under the impression that I am at home and that little Sam is with me — I hope that you keep Emelina at her knitting . I am fearful that the children will not be so well fixed this winder as they have always been before. I promise myself to be more useful when I return.

I was also invited to join a Pic-nic on saturday but owing to the days being so unfavorable it was given out. I felt a little disappointed for I know it would have been pleasant. We intended spending the day about two miles from Town at the Sulphur Springs , a very pretty place it is I am told.

Mr. Smith has requested each one of the girls to write home, and see if it is their parents wish that they should take Drawing lessons, but I think that I have as many studies as I can possibly attend to. he expects a Tutoress on in a few days, who will teach nothing but drawing painting \u0026 Embroidery.
