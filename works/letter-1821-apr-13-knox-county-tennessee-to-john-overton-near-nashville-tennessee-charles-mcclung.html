I will state that Uncle Miller contemplated the sale of his Warrant only; To that point alone, the power of attorney was intended, and I was requ requested to state that two dollars per acre in current bank notes was the lowest price that would be receiving I presume no lot was drawn on this Warrant, nor contract made or proposed to be made for locating it, and that it yet remains in the Commissioners Office, Mr Mister McMillen lives some distance above Knoxville , is a very old frail man and who I seldom see, I will write to him on the subject, and should he be disposed to have his Warrant located, (which I think he will not) I will several words penciled in throughout letter have been left out prepare a full power of attorney from him to you, and have it authenticated so as to be admitted to Record, and forward it to you, The object of Charles's settlement at Courtland is entirely mercantile, with no value of acquiring more real estate than a lot or part of a lot to build a stone house on, We had more capital than could be profitably used here, and the dificulty difficulty , I may say imposibility impossibility of attaining Eastern funds here, has necessitated us to form an establishment some place where Eastern funds can be procured, this we contemplate doing (for both Homes ) by the purchase of Cotton at Courtland , But were I disposed to purchase lands in that

what he purchased, and as high as $107, per acre was given for farming land, many of those lands must revert to the U.S United States . and when again sold will in all probability not bring an fourth part of what they had been sold for, In this calculation it is necessary to take into view that the Indian claim is extinguished to the lands in this state lying between the Tennessee \u0026

depression of situation, than on lattitude latitude then the lands between Tennessee and Mississippi lie lower than the lands above the shoals, a distance equal to the fall of the rivers Tennessee ,
