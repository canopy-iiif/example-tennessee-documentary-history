It has been some weeks since we received a letter from you, which makes us all feel very anxious fearing you are sick, which I hope is not the case, as I still have a strong presentiment your health will improve, and it is with pleasure I look forward to that period, which I hope is not far distant when, you will return to us as well and cheerful as ever. I miss you more and more every day, if I see hear or read any thing that strikes my fancy, I invariably think of repeating it to you, but the sad recholection recollection soon returns, you are absent. We were all agreeably surprised last week, in receiving several numbers of the Presbyterian, it is what we have often wished for, it is not as large a paper as the Nashvill Nashville Presbyterian but I think it equally as good, yesterday we received Atkinson's Saturday evening news, if all is an it, that it speaks of, it must be quite interesting, my Father complains of the bad print.
