The Mail has just arrived and no letter for me, indeed I do feel very uneasy. Now that the sickly season is comming coming I cannot be satisfied with less than one letter a Week. If Sister is well eneough enough to write, I want her to write to me. I think as I have so many Brothers some of them might write to me often. Yesterday we all went to church to hear Genl. General Harrison funeral, preached by Bishop Polk . (I believe it was his funeral, or at least something about him) It was the best sermon that I have heard since I have been Columbia, but I being quite weak slept most of the time, but I have no doubt that you will say that it was very wrong for me to do so.
