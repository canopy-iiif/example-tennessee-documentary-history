Meigs the Agent has officially stated to me by sent me a letter in his official capacity containing a list of a number of names stated by him of persons (as he says) residing on Indian lands contrary to treaty and that the Indians demanded thier their removal. He says that the President is determined to prevent all such intrusions and that he ( Col Colonel Meigs ) by his orders he is bound to take effectual measures to have all such settlers removed. Whether this will be done by commencing prosecution as law or by the federal troops or both, I have not been informed Knowing this to be the case these facts I think it a duty I owe you as Citizens of Tennessee to communicate the information and again to repeat my former advice, that to you to remove from the lands secured to the Indians by treaty, that you may avoid the disagreeable consequences which will probably result from a contrary conduct.
