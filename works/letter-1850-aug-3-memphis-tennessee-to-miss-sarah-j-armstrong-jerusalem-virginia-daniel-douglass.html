My curiosity caused me to move those which I preserved from one part of the paper to another and I thus obtained some better specimens than I expected. A florist in Charleston told me that the coarsest paper (straw paper) was the best. You are wrong in your notions with regard to Lancaster county Pa Pennsylvania ; the surface of that county is generally undulating, in some places rising by easy slopes so the height of four or five hundred feet. There are some spurs of the Blue Ridg Ridge which the natives dignify with the name of mountains but the the higest highest of them will not much excuse that above mentioned. Altogether Lancaster is one of the most beautiful portions of our beautiful country that I have seen it is justly called the garden of America. The population is very dense, the county alone constitutes a congressional district, and after the census if the apportionment was not changed would have to spare about one third of its number to another district. It is also wealthies wealthiest agricultural district in the United States with all all these advantages, however the people are the most illiteral that it has been my lot to meet with. I was verry very soon disgusted with them and on the sixth of July left there with the sincere hope that if I ever see it again, it may be on my way to some other place.

Once on the river my toil began, the river was so low that it was impossible to see over the banks, and before we got to Cincinnatti Cincinnati I was quite sick, and continued so till we reached cairo at the mouth of the Ohio. In consequence of my sickness I had no chance to look about the cities of Cincinnatti and Louisville or any of the towns on the river. I have never been on any river the banks of which ever as devoid interest as the Mississippi that portion of it which I saw is remarkable for nothing but its verry muddy water.
