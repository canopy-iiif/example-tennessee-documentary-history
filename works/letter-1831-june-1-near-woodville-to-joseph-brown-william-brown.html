The last summer was very dry in this country \u0026 corn crops were not generally good but the late rains made generally very good crops of cotton. The last winter was the severest that I have seen in this country \u0026 the early part of spring very wet \u0026 we are now suffering for the want of the rain. I have nothing to say on political subjects only that our State does not go with South Carolina in its nullifying policy; although most of our Citizens think the tariff of the United States is oppression in the Southern section of the Union, but they still think it a small evil compared to civil war with its accompanying horrors. Please give our most affectionate respects to my aged Mother, Brothir Brother \u0026 Sistir Sister Anderson \u0026 accept them for yourself \u0026 family, remember us affectionately to Aunt Duffill and all our relatives in your section of country. Please to write as often as convenient you know the difficulty that I labour labor under in writing from my hand being crippled, but you could write frequently. I remain with respect your affectionate brother Wm William Brown"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6208/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:6209/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6208/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/tdh","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6208","label":{"en":["[Letter] 1831 June 1 Near Woodville [to] Joseph Brown / William Brown"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/subject/crop-losses.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/place/tennessee.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/format/correspondence.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/date/june-1-1831.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"[Letter] 1831 June 1 Near Woodville [to] Joseph Brown / William Brown - Untitled","description":"Untitled","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1831-june-1-near-woodville-to-joseph-brown-william-brown","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6208/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1831 June 1 Near Woodville [to] Joseph Brown / William Brown"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1831-june-1-near-woodville-to-joseph-brown-william-brown"},"buildId":"xpOqSKtXe5nioP5W4wpQX","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
