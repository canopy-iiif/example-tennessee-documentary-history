A few friends have been so kind as to unite with us, in borrowing money to make the first payment. Two anual annual payments are still due, for which we and our friends are bound. All the subscriptions we have received are payable in one, two and three years, but least three forths fourths of them are payable in land or property, such as cannot be converted in to cash without a Great Sacrifice; and consiquently consequently will not aid us much in paying the purchase we have made. we have now to procure horses, stock, farming utensils, furniture for the boarding house, and provisions for the present year, together with some necessary buildings, which will require ready cash. Brother, we have launched our bark on the ocean of experiment. we must weather the storm. \"We must not lie on our oars; but tug for our lives\", until we reach the desired haven. But after all we must eventually sink without assistance. Some of our oldest, most-experienced and influential Preachers, must reach forth a helping hand, in this our time of extreme necessity; and spend their time, between this and the commencement of the camp meeting season, in riding and collecting funds.
