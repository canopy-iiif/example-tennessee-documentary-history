I have defered deferred from time to time writing hoping that I should be able to give the details of the most important subjects before us, of this however I am still denied the opportunity in part, The bill to establish a state bank and for other purposes emalgamating amalgamating internal improvement education c et cetera is still pending and from appearances is most likely to prove a troublesome and vextious vexatious subject the friends of this measure are quite unwilling to separate the bank from the other provisions of the bill, while the friends of the bank cannot support it with them attached to it The bill proposes to sell the bonds of the state amounting to six millions one million seven hundred thousand to be applied in E East Tennessee to internal emprovement improvement one million 3 hundred thousand to the same purpose in the Ne Northeast District 2 millions to be vested in a state bank in Middle Tenn. Tennessee and the remainder left as a bate bait held out to us in this portion of the state for the purposes of internal emprovement improvement , and the proceeds of the bank relied on for the payment of the whole debt, and this is urged as if the benefits of the were not to diffuse itself over the whole state, if there should be benefits derived from a bank, the policy of which remains yet to be tried, in all these project, of improvement by the provisions of the bill the Governor is to subscribe for half of the stock, not satisfied with the law of 35 authorizing one third to be taken by the state but another step reaching to one half is made of this latter policy you have often heard my opinion, and I fear I may have cause to regret that I did not vote for a repeal of the law of 1835 above alluded to. You have no doubt heard much of the Whig rejoicing at the news from New York the accounts of the illumination here are much exagerated exaggerated not more than one half of the houses on the square were illuminated and as far as my observation extended not that many in other places or parts of this great would be Whig city the point in Tennessee at which"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9660/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1837 Dec. 11 [to] Jesse Abernathy Esq[ui]r[e], Pulaski, Tennessee / W[illia]m R Brown : page 2"]},"width":3531,"height":4279,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9659~datastream~JP2/full/441,535/0/default.jpg","width":441,"height":535,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9659~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1/page/tdh:9659","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1/page/tdh:9659/656b69f5b8d9d","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9659~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3531,"height":4279,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9659~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"Henry Clay has been fairly put in nomination for the next presidency by the once pretended friends of Andrew Jackson , yes sir it can no longer be disguised that Henry Clay is the candidate of the Whigs in Tennessee for the first office in this nation and selected by those who but a short time since were crouching and paying homage at the feet of the venerable expresident ex-president who would have thought this a few short months ago? Not a man in five hundred in this state. The Presidents message has reached us, and is generally spoken of as an able document, I have read it with much care and am fully prepared to say to use a common phrase it is as plumb as a line, you will see it for yourself soon I shall therefore suspend further remarks untill until we shall see each other. I am told that friend Estes has sold his press and that it is still in the hands of the Whigs, What a pity is this, how much to be lamented it is that we have no one in Giles possessed of public spirit enough to vest a few dollars in rescuing so formidable an engine as the press from the hands of our enemies, it is useless to to tell me that that paper has had no influence in shaping the politics of Giles County there are many in that county who read no other paper and whose minds are have been influenced by it to take the course the have done, and all that is wanting to redeem Giles is to expose the tricks, so to speak, of the enemies of republican principles, Giles County is republican in her principles and might be restored to her first love if the proper means were brought into requisition. I know the people there too well to indulge a different thought for a single moment, of them, As to the entimation intimation in yours relative to my again presenting myself before the people in the capacity of a candidate for office I at this time have not the most distant idea of doing so my political aspirations are entirely cured and the fever for such pursuits perfectly cooled off for even in my short experience I have learned that few men can engage in politics without feeling the thorns that are always strewed along his path prick him sorely at almost every turn again men with whom one has to act in the discharge of his public duties too often look look look ahead to promotion at the expense of public good and I now say to you that if in anything I have contributed an humble mite might to the welfare of those who sent me here however humble that mite might may be"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9659/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/2","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1837 Dec. 11 [to] Jesse Abernathy Esq[ui]r[e], Pulaski, Tennessee / W[illia]m R Brown : page 3"]},"width":3543,"height":4235,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9658~datastream~JP2/full/443,529/0/default.jpg","width":443,"height":529,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9658~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/2/page/tdh:9658","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/2/page/tdh:9658/656b69f6f082c","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9658~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3543,"height":4235,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:9658~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/2"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/2/annopage-2","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9656/canvas/2/annopage-2/annotation-2","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"I am amply rewarded for all my efforts to do so and at the expiration of the time for which I was elected shall cheerfully surrender the charge confided to me and will never again undertake or desire so important a station though I know it to be and humble one.

The old Hero talks as fluently about banks and in fact on all subjects whatever his head is clear and mind strong apparently as if he were in the prime of life his health has much emproved improved since he was here about 4 weeks since he is a venerable looking man his person much altered since I saw him 10 or 12 years ago.

Tennessee though she is march back in solid colums columns . Now it is my opinion that when Mr Mister Bell sees that the bill to charter Yeatman Woods bank was rejected by the senate of a Tennessee legislature and his plan of getting a N Bed US bank of Pennsyl vania is defeated confidence in the states returning to the good old republican of Massachusetts as speedily as he anticipated I have just recd received a letter from Charles you may read this to him and other of our friends if you think proper.

Brown. In the letter, Brown expressed concern regarding the influence of the Whigs in the state of Tennessee, particularly in Giles County, where Whigs had obtained control of the press. He stated that Henry Clay would be the presidential candidate of the Whigs to rival current president Andrew Jackson. Brown further stated that he had relinquished his political aspirations and had no plans to run for office. He also discussed the issues of banks and a pending bill in the Tennessee legislature that would funnel bond money into the creation of a state bank in Middle Tennessee. Another bill proposing to charter a bank was earlier rejected by the Tennessee senate.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1837-dec-11-to-jesse-abernathy-esquire-pulaski-tennessee-william-r-brown","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A9656/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1837 Dec. 11 [to] Jesse Abernathy Esq[ui]r[e], Pulaski, Tennessee / W[illia]m R Brown"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1837-dec-11-to-jesse-abernathy-esquire-pulaski-tennessee-william-r-brown"},"buildId":"IQCZ0oVD0hJs59bVvYwiE","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
