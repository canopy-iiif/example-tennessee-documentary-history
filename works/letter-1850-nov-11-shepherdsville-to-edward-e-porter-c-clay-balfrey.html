You might make the bet which you propose, via: \"that I will not fall in love soon with a child of 16.\" with the greatest certainty of winning, for I think it is reduced to a mathamatical mathematical certainty that I cannot love any thing that wears peticoats petticoats for some years to come, but, Should the time come when I am possesed possessed for loveing loving , 16 years of age would never make the slightest difference with me, for it is my private opinion that if impressions made at the age of 16 do not continue, they will not at any subsequent age.

In the letter, Balfrey mentions the fact that many people have been getting married and that marriage seems to be the popular thing to do at the time. He also mentions that Edward's former landlord, a man named Nick Simmons, was shot in the back in a fight and has recovered. He concludes by saying that he wishes for Edward and himself to renew their friendship after some previous disagreements.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1850-nov-11-shepherdsville-to-edward-e-porter-c-clay-balfrey","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A8532/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1850 Nov. 11, Shepherdsville, [to] E[dward] E.
