In the letter, Sevier informed these men that he had received word of a meeting to be held with the commissioners of Georgia regarding a road that would be built connecting the two states, which would also run through Cherokee lands. Sevier commanded the men to attend the meeting, and he gave further instructions of the agreements to be made with the Georgian commissioners.
