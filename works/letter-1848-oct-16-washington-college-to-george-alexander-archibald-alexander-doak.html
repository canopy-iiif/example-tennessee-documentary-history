My own impression is that under the circumstances he will not attend to his studies any more and I would suggest that some active occupation would be more likely to engage his attention than study. I paid his tuition to the Treasurer of the Board before I knew of his intention to leave whether they will refund or not I do not know as it is against their rules. As the Board pay me a stated salary I can have no control in this matter. The servant I had engaged proved to be utterly worthless and and as Francis is well pleased at Mr Stuart's I think of letting him remain here at least for the present. If the servant you made mention of as being for sale could be hired I would like to hire but I am not able to buy. Francis is desirous of private instruction in addition to the regular College course. I am willing to give him private instruction but it would cost him much more as it would require the same amount of labour as to teach a class of ten_ The ordinary price of private in instruction is fifty dollars per session_ I could not charge less than thirty If you prefer his taking the common course you will please inform"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8975/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1848 Oct. 16, Washington College [to] George Alexander / Archibald Alexander Doak : page 2"]},"width":1668,"height":1931,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8974~datastream~JP2/full/417,483/0/default.jpg","width":417,"height":483,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8974~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/1/page/tdh:8974","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/1/page/tdh:8974/656b693ce2d8a","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8974~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":1668,"height":1931,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8974~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8972/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"me.
