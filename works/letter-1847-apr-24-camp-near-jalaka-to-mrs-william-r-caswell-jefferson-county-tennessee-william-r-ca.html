I have for a long time ⁁ believed that immediately after some anticipated occurrence, just before us, we should be discharged and permitted to return home — In all this I have been disappointed until now I have concluded that tho' though possibly we may soon return home from this place, yet probably we shall be retained in the service until the end of our term. I was very much disappointed in finding the Mexicans prepared to make a stand in the mountains at Sierra Gorda, for I thought we should have no more fighting. — I had 24 men mounted besides Sam. Samuel Bell \u0026 myself at the time the army marched from Vera Cruz , they were the only horses of our Regiment which had arrived — We ⁁ alone of our Regiment marched with the army, and were in the battle — And from the time we left Very Cruz up to our arrival here a few days since I was put upon constant duty with my few men. — Conveying despatches dispatches to Genl General — Twiggs in front to Gen General Scott in rear \u0026 to the different corps of the army by riding night and day — guarding provender and provision trains ⁁ \u0026 escorting staff General, — Staff and Engineer officers upon reconnoitering \u0026 tours of survey — which was a hazardous service, for on one of there excursions 18 of us were attacked by a party of Ranchero's some 30 or 40 I think ( tho' though the a company of Dragoons and a company of Infantry who had a skirmish with the same party on the day afterwards report them to have numbered 2 or 300—) We charged and ran them into the chaperal chaparral — dismounted and drove them off — In this I had two men wounded (one of whom died) but I brought off my wounded and waggons wagons In the battle of the 18th I formed my men with the reserve of Genl. General Pillows Brigade— ready to dash upon the enemy whenever the storming party should have obtained possession of the enemy breast works, they were however repulsed as you will see reported — With my men I was exposed to the fire of the cannon and musketry, but all escaped unhurt — I shall tire you many times hereafter with the particulars of all I have seen \u0026 heard on this campaign, and this is my excuse for not writing more at large in my letter — Indeed I feel like writing about nothing but returning home, — And now let me tell you your prospects in that great end of the campaign to which I look with so much anxiety — Gen. General North has gone forward to the Castle of Perote , which is considered one of the enemy's strongest fortifications; and it was supposed that the enemy would fight us there if any where on the route to Mexico — But instead of finding the enemy in force at Perote — Gen.
