I called upon the editor of the Village Messenger published at this place immediately after receiving it; who says, \" The Peoples Friend\" shall have a place in his paper regularly, as each No Number is received from Nashville . The first No Number appeared in our paper of last week, the second, which are all that have yet arived arrived at this place, will appear in our next. I was confined three or four days last week by a bilious attack; every symptom of which is, however at length, removed. This circumstance will account for my not having answered your letter sooner; as I was not able to write when the mail left this place for last week for Nashville. The interest you have ever manifested for my wellfare welfare from an early period of our acquaintance encourages me to express my desire, that you would continue to write to me, as often as your leisure and convenience may permit. I have often thought that I would ask of you this favour, but knowing as I did, that your age and health were scarcely equal to the constant attention necessarily required in the management of your business, I have feared, the request might justly be considered unreasonable. I would therefore ask you to write to me only"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6109/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:6112/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6109/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1827 Aug. 7, Fayetteville, Tn.
