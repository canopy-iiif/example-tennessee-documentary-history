We had twenty two miles to ride. Both our driver and road were literally rough, and our passage consequently rough. At two o'clock, P.M., we came in sight of the camp. The prisoners were directed to walk, and the guard to march in close order. Before the wagon rode two of the guard; immediately behind were the prisoners; while the remaining part of the company brought up the rear. As we approached the camp, the massy gates leading into the yard were opened by the sentinel within, and with all due formality the wagon, prisoners, and guard moved onward, passing in front of the quarters of Col. Sanford , Col. Nelson , and those of all the privates, when we found ourselves at the jail. A halt was made.
