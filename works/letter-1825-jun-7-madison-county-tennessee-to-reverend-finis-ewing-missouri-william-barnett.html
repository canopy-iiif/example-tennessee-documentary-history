Brother Ewing By the blessing of an indulgent God we are all alive, and enjoying the blessings of health for which I desire to be thankful, to the giver of all our mercies. Yours of the 11th of March was thankfully received, \u0026 highly esteemed, I have read it over, and over, again, and again also, I have read it many times to many of the Breathren Brethren who all rejoice with me, to hear our, dear old friend talk, if it be on paper, yes, it does my heart good, to see any thing that revives in my mind our good old times, yes I have always numbered them amongs amongst my greatest mercies, looking back on the few short, but sweet years we spent in pulling in the gospel yoak togeather together . Ah! I look back on them with mournful pleasure then I had a Councilor, a guide, a friend, an associate, in labour labor , as well, as one of the dearest companions I ever had, But those sweet seasons are gone, and they are gone forever; I fear never turn. I thankfully received all parts of your letter, Especially that part which related to the change of our Church judicatory judiciary \u0026c et cetera \u0026c my mind has been, and yet is labouring greatly on that subject We had a talk on that subject in our little Presby Presbytery , and the P Presbytery expressed her mind, after much had been said on all sids sides , they were all decided for a General Assembly, except myself, Under this I groaned, if I am rong wrong , I felt unpleasant, that I was unfortunate enough to differ from all my Breathren, if I be right, I am so small a minority, that I have no hopes of carrying my point. As far as I have learned the minds of severaly P. they are almost universally in favor of an Assembly, I hope God will overrule for his glory, and the good of our little Church-- We had a harmonious week full, yet I hope, a profitable Presbytery, all the members were presant present , The Anderson P. sent us three young preachers somewhat promising, The N Nashville P. acted just like its self itself , one young man came from there to ride this summer, and then return; we have six circuitriders circuit riders , I hope good will be the result,- as far as I can learn it is a lamentable cold time in the church; O!
