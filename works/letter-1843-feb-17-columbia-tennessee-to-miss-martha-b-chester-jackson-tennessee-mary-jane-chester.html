You can imagine with what delight I was undeceived. I hasten to answer yours, hoping that you will follow my example. From your many promises before I left home, I satisfied myself with the idea that in you, I should certainly find a regular correspondant correspondent ; but the excuse which you offer, I consider a very good one, also, in this case acceptable. As I have not written home since the Examination I shall devote a few lines of this letter in giving you a partial description of it. I have no doubt, but that you feel some anxiety to hear.

I took my first lesson on the Guitar yesterday, and am very much pleased with it, I think that I shall like it more than the Piano, but am determined not to neglect the Piano, as I know that is Papa's favorite Instrument. I intend trying to improve my voice this session, for the Guitar Music is very poor, without it is accompanied with a good voice.

I have various speculations, concerning the cause of your not writing, It may be be that your time is too much occupied with your school duties, in Hunting, or you dislike to writing is the reason, notwithstanding all these reasons, I do think, that you might have taken time to write to me at least once. Tell brother Robert I dont do not know any excuse, he could have for not writing. It would give me great pleasure to receive a letter from him. he must give me a description of every thing relating to Home — How you all come one, if King \u0026 Will have grown any, and if little Sam is as fine a fellow as ever, \u0026 if he talks much about his sister Janey, and wants to see me.
