Your communication for the Union has been given to the public as you will have seen.

What they will do with Ridley 's resolutions, now lying on the table of the House, specifically approving severally of the leading measures of the administration, and of the conduct of the President separately in relation to each, yet remains to be seen. These resolutions are framed with a special view of having a distinct vote taken in relation to each important measure. It will be a sore pill to some hypocrites and some apostates to be forced to vote in that way, but they will be compelled to do it or disgrace themselves by giving the go by, in some way, to the whole in a mass. — In debate, we have decidedly the advantage of talents.

It is a matter, however, of great importance here, for we now feel certain that if Bell finds he can't beat Polk himself, he is determined to try to have it done by another, and he would like to have that other to be one of our friends.
