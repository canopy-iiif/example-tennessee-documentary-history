In the letter, Jackson is still challenging Sevier to a duel and is agreeable to meet him at the Cumberland Gap in Virginia. Jackson suggests that Sevier name the time for when they are to meet. This letter was refused delivery by Governor Sevier, saying that he wanted nothing to do with the letter, duel, or Jackson, and was therefore never read.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1803-oct-11-knoxville-tennessee-to-john-sevier-andrew-jackson","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6746/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1803 Oct. 11, Knoxville, Tennessee [to] John Sevier / Andrew Jackson"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"letter-1803-oct-11-knoxville-tennessee-to-john-sevier-andrew-jackson"},"buildId":"rzcfyjUSMlYWCfG4_eAp1","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
