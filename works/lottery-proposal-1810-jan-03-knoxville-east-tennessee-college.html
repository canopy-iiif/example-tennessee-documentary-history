Part of the above Prizes determinable as follows , to wit: 1st drawn Blank on the 5th day's drawing, Dolls. Dollars 100 1st ditto, 7th ditto, 100 1st ditto, 9th ditto, 300 1st ditto, 13th ditto, 300 1st ditto, 15th ditto, 500 1st ditto, 17th ditto, 500 1st ditto, 19th ditto, 1,000 1st drawn Ticket on the 22d, and last day's drawing, 2,500 500 Tickets to be drawn each day . Prizes payable thirty days after the completion of the drawing, subject to a deduction of fifteen per cent percent . And those prizes not demanded within twelve months, shall be considered as relinquished for the benefit of the College. The Lottery, of which the above is the Scheme, has the sanction of an Act of the last Legislature. That act, requires the subscribers to give bond, that the Prizes shall be paid, or the money refunded, if the Lottery should not be drawn: This requisition has been complied with. We flatter ourselves, that the Scheme will be satisfactory to all who wish to become adventurers, with a view to better their circumstances. Little more than two blanks to a prize. No prize that will not yield some profit to the fortunate drawer. The prizes to be paid, not in this, or in that species of property, but in CASH, which will command property of every description. No doubts are entertained but a sufficient number of Tickets will be sold to enable the drawing to be commenced in a short time. When the object to be attained by this Lottery is considered, it is believed, every individual will be anxious to become an adventurer. It is not designed to retrieve a shattered fortune, nor to convert into cash, at an extravagant price, property which is of no use ; but it is intended to aid the funds of a Seminary of Education, where youth of the present and succeeding generations, may have their minds prepared, in such a manner, as to make them ornaments to their families, and useful to their country as will enable them to understand their rights as citizens, and their duties as servants of the people. If we are attached to the government under which we live If we wish to have it transmitted to our posterity, let us unite in the support of Seminaries of learning; without them, our children must be ignorant; while ignorant, they will be ever liable to be misled by the designing, and finally, to be governed by some enterprizing enterprising despot. With Seminaries of Education, well endowed, those of every rank and description will become informed; they will understand their government, the powers and rights which it confers and secures; when these are understood, they will never be yielded but with their lives. We therefore respectfully solicit, and hope to receive the public patronage. HUGH L. WHITE, THOMAS McCORRY, JAMES CAMPBELL, ROBERT CRAIGHEAD , JOHN N. GAMBLE, Trustees appointed by Act of Assembly.
