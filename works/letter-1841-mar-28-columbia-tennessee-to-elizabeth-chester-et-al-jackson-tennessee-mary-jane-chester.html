I was very much grieved to hear that Mama was so sick when you arrived at home but I hope by this time that she is perfectly recovered — If she is it would give me so much pleasure to receive a letter from her — Papa you cannot imagine how much pleasure your visit gave ⁁ me but I wish to see almost as much as I did before you came, I wish that you all would live in Columbia, how until I finish my Education, I know that it is a very selfish wish but you know it is impossible for human nature to be without some portion of selfishness. I was very much pleased to hear that Aunt Patsey has recovered her health. I expect that her sickness was occasioned by Uncle Will's absence but now that the time is so fast approaching for him to return she will get well I can assure you then. As soon as Uncle returns I want him to write me a long letter for he has never written me one line since I been away from home but I can can can excuse that as he has not been at ho me When he returns I must have a letter from him. Aunt Walker has had a very severe spell since — O she has suffered so much, they were all very uneasy about her, but they think that she is something better this morning. I have not been there since you left Columbia, for Mr Smith is so very strict about us leaving the Institute. I suppose that you have received the third Number of the Guardian. there is an account of every thing respecting Miss Julia Gordon . Some of her own writings Papa you cannot imagine how much she was beloved by all her class mates. Tell Cousin Dick that he must answer my letter soon.

Nevertheless the Western District stands very very high in my estimation. Mama you must not think that I am trying to praise myself but just to think of Mr S — Smith being so deceitful.
