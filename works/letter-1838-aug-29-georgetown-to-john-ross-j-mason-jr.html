I was much gratified to find that you your Indian friends had the entire disposal of this important matter- this arrangement will resound equally to the honor of Winfield General Scott the government to the comfort I trust, satisfaction of the Cherokees , under the trying painful circumstances, in which, all have been placed. I congratulate you therefore your friends, upon the happy determination of this branch of the subject. I have now a proposition to make, to which I invite your serious consideration that of your Cherokee friends. On establishing yourselves in the West, you will, besides subsistence, necessarily require for the use of all your people, a great quantity variety of articles necessary to their comfort well being- Such as woolens cottons, for clothes- blankets- hardware of all sorts- glass- agricultural implements- mechanics tools- groceries- arms powder c c et cetera et cetera - all these can in greater or lesser quantities, be doubtless bought, in the West, from Merchants Traders; who foreseeing your wants may have goods ready to supply them.
