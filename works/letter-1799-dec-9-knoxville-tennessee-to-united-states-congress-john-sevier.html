Cherokees the latter were given to understand that the present Ferry across Clinch, which is much to their emolument should in future be the ferry across that river under the fifth article of the

road__ If any have a right to exact any sum however small, they may exact any other sum however large, and thereby deprive the Citizens of the United States of the benefit of the Stipulation for a free road.__ The principle is the same, extended to a cent a pound or a million__ Secondly, That it takes cash from the pockets of those who are compelled to pay this ferriage for the benefit of the indians, and is Singularly oppressive to the movers to Mero district with their families, wagons, baggage and Stock as much so that many of them heretofore have been compelled to fall a part of their
