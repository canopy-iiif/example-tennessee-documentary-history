I expect it was about such information as I received thro' through Majr. C. Major Campbell I have only received one letter from you (and that was by Lieut. Lieutenant Turnley ) Since I left home. I suppose my letters have been sent to San Antonio . - If I had recd. received them I should have had many of my anxious conjectures explained, relative to your heath health \u0026 comfort, relative to Eliza, to our little boy - to your Ma, \u0026 Mary, Alfred , Henry , Ann \u0026 our family, our servants, our neighbours neighbors - \u0026 c et cetera - What has become of Thos.

Captain Caswell was a volunteer from Tennessee who served in the Mexican-American War. In the letter, Caswell expresses his unhappiness that his wife has not written to him in a while, in addition to his concern for her and their family's health. Caswell also discusses events going on in the war and the character of the other soldiers stationed with him. He concludes the letter by expressing his, as well as another soldier's, interest in learning to speak Spanish in order to understand what is being said around him.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1846-oct-10-to-mrs-william-r-caswell-william-r-caswell","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A156/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1846 Oct. 10 [to] Mrs. W[illia]m R.
