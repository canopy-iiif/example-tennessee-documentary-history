Letter of Miss Fuller , teacher at Hightower , To Mr. Worcester , detailing the circumstances of the visit of the Georgia guard to that station, the second arrest of Mr. Thompson , June 22: dated June 23, 1831 Rev. and Dear Sir It falls to my lot to communicate to you notice of Mr. Thompson 's second arrest, together with the circumstances which led to it, so far as they have come under my observation. Last evening, about 6 O'clock, Col. Nelson called on me, inquired for Mr. Thompson , and also respecting my situation, and made a single remark respecting the loneliness of it. Mr. Thompson was absent of course I told him so. He then told me that as he found me here situated as I am, he should not occupy this house the next night, but with much assurance added, \"We shall occupy it tomorrow night,\" He further said, \"You can go or stay as you please. If you stay you shall be protected\" My reply was, \" I must stay,\" \"Very well,\" said he, and again repeated his promise of protection. He then remarked that they considered it their privilege to occupy these abandoned places; spoke of being somewhat troubled for forage for his horses, and intimated that what was growing on these places belonged to them; that nothing of last year's growth would"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:627/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Extract from a] letter, 1831 June 23, Hightower Mission, [Cherokee Nation] to Mr. [Samuel] Worcester : page 2"]},"width":2347,"height":2883,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:626~datastream~JP2/full/293,360/0/default.jpg","width":293,"height":360,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:626~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/1/page/tdh:626","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/1/page/tdh:626/656b615d0830a","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:626~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":2347,"height":2883,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:626~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/624/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"be required, but only the present; \"for,\" said he, \"we consider them as intrusions upon our state.\" However much I might have felt disposed to remonstrate, I had not sufficient command of my feelings to permit me to do it. Supposing that it must be so, if Mr. Thompson did not return before the appointed time, and not being certain that he would, I asked Col. Nelson what part of the house he should occupy, \"One room will be sufficient for us, there are only ten of us,\" was his answer. Providentially, however, Mr. Thompson arrived about an hour after Col. Nelson 's call. He felt it his plain duty, not passively to yield the possession of his house into Col. Nelson 's hands, and accordingly dispatched a messenger to him, early this morning, with a letter, of which the following is a copy. Hightower Mission, June 23. 1831 Col. Charles H. Nelson , Sir, I have been informed that you design to occupy the mission-house this evening, with a detachment of the Georgia guard. In regard to this subject, we can only say, that we have not the accommodations desirable to entertain yourself and company, and for this, and other reasons, you will excuse me in saying, that if your design is effected, it will be without my consent.
