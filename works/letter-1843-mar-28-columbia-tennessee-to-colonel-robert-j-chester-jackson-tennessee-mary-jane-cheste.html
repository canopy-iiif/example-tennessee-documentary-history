There is an old weather Wizzard Wizard living here, who has predicted one more snow this Spring, which will be six feet deep , but I must confess that I have not much faith in his predictions. Cousin Sam will be in Jackson next week. Oh! you have no idea how sincerely I wish that I was in his his place for indeed it appears to me, that I should be perfectly, happy if I could see you all again, but I console with the idea that I have only three more months to be sepperated separated from you.
