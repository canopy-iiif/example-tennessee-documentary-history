I was in Murfreesborough Murfreesboro on Saturday last and Aunt Peggy Taylor gave me the stocks which you had the kindness to send me; the velvet one was a great deal too large, but the other one fitted me pretty well. Nothing would please me more than to receive a letter from you My Dear Mother, but knowing that you are generally unwell, I do not want you to write when you are unwell, for fear that you would fatigue yourself, but I hope that you will write to me before I return. I want to see you all very much in deed, and you in particular, since I left home, I have found out since I have been up here that there's no place like Home; I lik like Mr. \u0026 Mrs Black very well and I think that they are very fine people and they have treated me very well. The session is only five weeks longer. I am very well. Give my love to all the family. Tell Mr. Douglass that Henry and John are well.
