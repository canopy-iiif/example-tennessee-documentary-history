I have received information the truth of which I cannot doubt, that many tribes of the Indians of Texas , and of our side of the unmarked but supposed boundary, have been engaged by the authorities of Mexico to aid in the war extermination against Texas. I have proof that the Cherokees under Bowl with the Caddoes have been so engaged. The Caddoes are reported to have 400 Warriors,- Bowl's Cherokees are estimated at less than 150. These tribes though not numerous are capable of being very formidable by their perfect knowledge of this country, by which they would have it in their power to lead the more westerly and northerly tribes into every settlement, and to every house on our side of the line, and as far as the Red River , from Alexandria to Fort Towson , and throughout the disputed Territory._ I have had reason to calculate on hostilities being commenced as soon as the Corn got ripe enough to eat- or as soon as the Mexican Army shall approach the remaining settlements of Texas- which are principally on this side of the Brazos .- The Mexican Army was however still at Matomoras on the"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5443/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5447/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5443/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1836 Aug. 10, Head Quarters West Depart[ment], Camp Sabine, To Brig[adier] Gen[era]l Arbuckle, Fort Gibson, Ark[ansa]s / E[dmund] P.

But should this be the cause of the suspended movements of the Mexican Army, it is certainly a cause that cannot long be relied on. Mexico may very soon order the new Commander to prosecute the War regardless of the fate of Santa Anna, as they have already reprimanded their General Filasola for retireing retiring from Texas at the request of Santa Anna, after the battle of San Jacinto ; and they have decreed that any act of Santa Anna while a prisoner of war shall be null and void. Besides the death of Santa Anna by sickness, accident, or otherwise, or his escape will be the signal for vigorous operations on the part of the Mexicans, and that the Indians will co-operate with them I have no doubt. Hence it is that I have deemed it necessary and proper to have the Dragoons, and the Six Companies of the 7th Infantry held in readiness for action upon the Nacogdoches frontier.

Gaines reports of hostility perceived and expected from Native American tribes in Texas, who were allying with the Mexican army during its war against Texas. He talks specifically about the Cherokees, led by Chief Bowl, who had been pushed west into Texas, and the Caddoes. Gaines also discusses the fate of Mexican leader Santa Anna, and he commends Arbuckle on his ordering of troops from Missouri and Arkansas to protect frontier settlers from possible Native American attacks.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1836-aug-10-head-quarters-west-department-camp-sabine-to-brigadier-general-arbuckle-fort-gibs","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A5443/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1836 Aug. 10, Head Quarters West Depart[ment], Camp Sabine, To Brig[adier] Gen[era]l Arbuckle, Fort Gibson, Ark[ansa]s / E[dmund] P.
