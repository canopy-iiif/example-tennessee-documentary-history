The object of the council and the reason for excluding the osages and Kansas, are unknown; but the Lieut Lieutenent Colonel states that there is no doubt in his mind that the object of the council is to effect a union of the different tribes preparatory to striking a simultaneous blow upon the settlements of Arkansas and missouri from the Red River to the upper Mississippi. concuring as I do in this opinion \u0026 being convinced that the cherokees of Texas and Arkansas have been instigated by the agents of Mexico , who have been endeavoring for more than two years past to organize a combination of cherokees with all the nations west of Arkansas and the state of Missouri a combination capable of bringing into action upon our frontier"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5452/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5456/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5452/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1838 Aug. 8, St. Louis [to] Governor Newton Cannon, Tennessee / Edmund P.
