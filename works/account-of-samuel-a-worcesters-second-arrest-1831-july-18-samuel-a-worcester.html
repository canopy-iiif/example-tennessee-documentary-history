Dr. Butler was considerably hurt, but the soldier none, having two ribs broken. After this, till they came to their lodgings, Dr. Butler was permitted to ride, while a soldier walked. In the mean time they lost their way in the woods. However, they found a pine knot, of which they made a torch by striking fire; and by this means recovered their way. Their lodging place was only 11 miles from Dr. Butlers , but it was midnight when they arrived, well drenched with rain. When they lay down, the prisoner was chained to his bedstead by the ancle ankle the officer, however, putting a handkerchief around under the chain. The next day they had 35 miles or more to travel. Dr. Butler wore the chain on his neck, but no longer fastened to a horse. He was occasionally permitted to ride, one or another of the soldier's walking in his stead. At night he was chained to Mr. McLeod and me. On Friday morning we had to cross the Hightower river in boat.
