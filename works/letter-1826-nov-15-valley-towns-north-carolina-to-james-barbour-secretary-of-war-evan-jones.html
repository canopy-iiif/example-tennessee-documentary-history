These improvements have been made under the direction of the Board of managers of the Baptist General convention and the utmost Econemy Economy has been uniformly observed in carrying them on. The Erection of the mills, which are now just finished became nessesary necessary in consequence of the former ones, situated on cabin creek 5 miles from the Mission house, being completely destroyed, by a tremendious tremendous Freshet on the night of the 20th of February last, which rendered our situation with regard to provisions very distressing: there being no mill that could supply the Establishment, within a distance of fifty miles. The present mills are situated on the River River Hiwasee . The works are all good and substantial, Both Mills are in operation and perform well. They will be a most valuable acquisition to this neighbourhood neighborhood and will greatly facilitate the progress which is making in Buildings, agriculture, and the civilized arts, though the state of the country as yet does not warrant the expectation of any profit from them. All the items contained in the enclosed statement are finished , but a considerable portion of the expence expense is unpaid, on account of the funds of our Board being at present very depressed. The aid of Government would therefore be peculiarly Acceptable at this time and I feel persuaded that the funds thus applied will very powerfully promote the cause of humanity which has been espoused by the U.S. Govt. and so zealously prosecuted by the Executive.
