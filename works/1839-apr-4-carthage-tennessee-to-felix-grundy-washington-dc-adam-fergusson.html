A question has been raised by Some as I am informed whether an attorney acting for a Pensioner can charge his reasonable expences expenses in travelling to Nashville and back or to be more explicit whether he can charge one dollar per day for himself and horse in travelling to draw a Pensioners claim. The oath is very binding Suficently Sufficiently So to prevent his being the least interested; but whether after paying to the Pensioner the whole of his money and then the Pensioner of his own free will pays to his attorney his expences while going for it creates Such an interest in the Pension as is contemplated in the oath he takes previously is the question I wish to know. If it shall be decided that an attorney cannot recieve receive no compensation whatever; Then will the aged and decrepid Pensioner whether male or female but more especially the female be more liable to be swindled out of the money which Government in its unbounded charity designed for their Suport Support . for then no person who values his character or reputation will act for them knowing the danger he incurs while the man of no character or feeling and who is not responsble responsible will be the only person the Pension can employ"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8385/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["1839 Apr. 4, Carthage, Tennessee [to] Felix Grundy, Washington [D.C.] / A[dam] Fergusson : page 2"]},"width":2990,"height":3850,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8384~datastream~JP2/full/374,481/0/default.jpg","width":374,"height":481,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8384~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/1/page/tdh:8384","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/1/page/tdh:8384/656b68b43e95b","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8384~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":2990,"height":3850,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8384~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8382/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"another queston question is whether in establishing a claim to a Pension under any of the late existing laws an attorney or agent who collects the proof records and other documents can charge a regular and Stated compensation.
