Yes, with pain, and pleasure I look back on the sweet and pleasant days, and years we spent in the vineyard togeather together , indeed I view them amongst the happiest hours ever rolled with me, I then had a Father to council, an aid in the Ministry, a dear companion in labour labor , an experienced Presbyter, and one in whom I had the utmost confidence, both as to his skill and aim; But the return of the spring reminds me of repairing to Gods House to council with my Breathren Brethren the best means to effect the end of promoting the redeemers Kingdom: With a down-cast-eye, and heavy heart; I ask myself where is Presbytery? and with whom will I meet? and on whom will I lean? The answer is what most pains my heart,__ It is not Uncle Fines, Bro,, Brother John , Harris Chapman \u0026c and etcetera \u0026c \u0026c But it is with a few unexperienced Boys and there is not one to look up to and what will give me most pain of all, is that with which you used to be pressed, by me, and others, ( viz videlicet ) when any of our members in Presbytery, rises to speak they will, I fear address themselves to me instead of the moderator, You no doubt recollect we used to pretend to address the Moderator But would look at and in truth address Uncle Fines.

Barnett complains that Ewing has not written him in a while. He writes that he will continue sending Ewing letters, though. Barnett writes extensively about his Presbytery. Barnett asks Ewing's advice on whether his Synod should change to a General Assembly because of its size. Barnett writes that he lives near Ewing's nephew, Joseph Lynn. He has many good things to say about Lynn and his family. He mentions having pains in his stomach that he believes are signs of a fatal illness. Barnett worries a great deal about his ability to stay a good, Christian man. He also worries about what will happen to him if he becomes unable to preach, as it is his only skill.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/1825-mar-19-madison-county-tennessee-to-finis-ewing-boonville-cooper-county-missouri-william-barnett","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A5612/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"1825 Mar. 19, Madison County, Ten[nessee] [to] Finis Ewing, Boonville, Cooper County, Missouri / W[illia]m Barnett"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"1825-mar-19-madison-county-tennessee-to-finis-ewing-boonville-cooper-county-missouri-william-barnett"},"buildId":"GoibdBG8wZ0BV9iTI83rS","assetPrefix":"/example-tennessee-documentary-history","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
