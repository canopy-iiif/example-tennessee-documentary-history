T. East Tennessee University, February 15, 1847. Dear John. With pain and difficulty do I make the effort of offering a friendly, but limited communication. I am sorely afflicted with a severe pain in my head and an aching of my back and limbs, which make me nervous and unsteady, and therefore I am in a bad situation to write. My shoulder aches and my hand is so unsteady, that it appears that I can not cannot write without blotting, and I regret to send a letter to a friend, which looks, as though a blacksmith had written it with a hand spike. But you must make allowances for this one, owing to the state of my health. I am unable to study any of consequence, for the anguish of my head is so severe, that it seems that I can not cannot bear to steady at any thing anything , much less to retain. I have not been in a recitition recitation room to-day today , and if I do not get better I think that I shall not recite anymore, but endeavor to get home. My mind is so confused that I am troubled to grasp any thing anything to reveal to you which may interest you, at all, and I am hard enough pressed in my best moments to produce subjects of importance and interest. I consider that we have, but little if any thing anything here to communicate, which deserves a high appreciation. We have a new student, who arrived here recently from Mississippi and we have got him into our building, though he has not joined our society; yet I think that he will for I think that we have obtained the right side of him. I have taken considerable pains with him by treating him friendly and familiarly, and he seems to be very much pleased with me so far, and also he seems to pleased with some of the other members. I am not like the Ph.'s when I wish to get a student in our society, for I beleve believe that they begin about the first thing to talk about their society; but I wish to gain a student's good will first."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9663/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9666/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9663/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1847 Feb. 15, E[ast] T[ennessee] University [to] Mr. John D.

On Saturday night last they were very disorderly, and after the close of debate, the resolution, which was past passed on Saturday night previous to invite the Faculty into our hall, was brought up and voted down by a large majority. Parshall has quit college and gone home, though I imagine that his departure will not produce much sorrow with the students. Charles and long Kirk I believe are well, and the health of the students generally is good; also their demeanor is considerably better than was it some time since. I had just got so that I could study to some advantage and was advancing much better in my studies; than I have done I believe all of the first part of the session; but I fear that this misery in my head will nearly, if not entirely break up my studying during this term. I am informed that Miss. Haverly is to be married to McKee , one of the editors of the Tribune. I have nothing more at present to offer to you; but to ask you to excuse my badly composed and badly written epistle. I am your true friend, R. M. Moore To. J. John D.
