It is now only two weeks until I see you, then Oh how very happy I expect to be. But it does not seem possible that I should go home again because I have been so long from you all to tell you the truth Mama when I left home I thought that I never would return. O! Mama you do not know how happy I feel whenever I think about home. Tell Aunt and brother that I am looking very anxiously for them, I have just received a letter from Cousin Dick saying that I expect them on Friday week, but that will be one day too late for the Examination as Bishop Otey has persuaded Mr Smith to have three days examination instead of two — it will commence on that day (Friday week) and continue until Wednesday; so you see that will give us so much more time so display our knowledge. Please write me any how one more letter befor before I return. I shall offer no excuses for my short letter, as you know how much my time is occupied at present. Give my love to Papa, the Children, all my Relations. Tell Bet that she must write to me, that ⁁ I answered her last letter and directed it to New Orleans , Give my love to her also.
