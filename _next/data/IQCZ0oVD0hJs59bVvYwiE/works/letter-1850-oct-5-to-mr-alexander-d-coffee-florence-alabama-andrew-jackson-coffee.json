I have not heard from Florence in so long a time that I do not know that any of you are in the land of the living however it is an old adage that \"no news is good news\". So I will take it for granted that all are well and thriving I have no news to write of much interest. I am happy to state that we are all in excellent health. Bettie , myself the children and the Servants. I suppose you are very busy with your work &c et cetera I hope I may be able to pay you a visit before very long when I will take much pleasure in visiting your butter biscuit and before a great while I suppose you will be visiting this notable city. If so I shall be most happy to entertain you during your visit and I will try to show you all the sights of the city. I see from a late law of Congress that there will be some \"Bounty Land\" coming to Ma for Pas Services in the Creek war of 1812 and the British war of 1814 & 1815. As soon as I am certain the terms of the laws &c et cetera I will prepare papers and so forth for the purpose of establishing the claims I will be worth some thing — Will you be so kind as to call on Jno John Simpson & Co Company and ascertain what has become of the notes I left in his hands for collection of Robt Robert and Wm William Warren has any money been collected or is there likely to be any. I have not heard a word from them and do not know what their position may be. One note was due 1 July 1849 the other 1 Jany January 1850 both amt amount $166.66 making $333.33 — Give our love to Ann , to Ma, Rachel , Cate , William , Joshua , and Andrew and our regards to all friends and accept the same for your self Your Brother Andrew J.
