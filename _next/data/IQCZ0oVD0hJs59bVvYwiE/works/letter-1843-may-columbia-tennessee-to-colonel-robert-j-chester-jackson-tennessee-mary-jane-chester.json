Do not infer from this, that I have not time to read them, I assure you I can always find a leisure moment. I am afraid from my oft-repeated complaints about time, you are of this opinion, & therefore I have the misfortune of receiving so very few letters from you. The Examination will commence on the last Wednesday in June. will continue until Friday night, I believe it is generally dreaded by the girls, for Mr. Smith tells us it will be more thorough than any he has ever yet had.
