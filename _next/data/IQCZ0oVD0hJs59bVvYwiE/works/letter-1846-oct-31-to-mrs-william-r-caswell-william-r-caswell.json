General Lamars, camp to hunt for your Uncle Frank , (whom I met on my way to Monterey, as I wrote you ⁁ in my last) and to my great disappointment, I found he had left the camp the night before and had gone with the main body of his company about 10 miles distant upon his way to Loredo —I wrote a note which I sent & which would overtake him before he should get any further, urging him to come back at once to my quarters in Carmango, but I had not heard from him when I left— I have met on board this boat, the 1st kinsman of my fathers' whom I have ever seen, a cousin of my father—his name is Gatlin, a brother of the Dr. Gatlin who was killed at Leade's battle ground in Florida — this gentlemen is a Captain in the U.S. United States Army— promoted from a Lieutenancy, for his gallantry in the battles of Resaca & Palo Alto — he has been wounded in the battle of Monterey, (in the arm)— and is on his way to the U.S. United States for the benefit of his general health which is not good— I think he is very much of a gentleman—"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/126/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:130/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/126/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1846 Oct. 31 [to] Mrs. William R.
