One of the New Orleans papers (the Argus) received here yesterday, says the Genls General's reception was cold & indifferent, that the streets were comparatively deserted as walked them; no demonstrations of Joy or satisfaction welcomed him, except from a few hot headed partizans partisans &c et cetera which makes the administration men of this town (and there are a good many) hold up their heads and excitingly taunt us with disappointment. On the contrary the \"Advertiser\" says the Gen General was welcomed by a greater concourse of people than was ever assembled in the City; which I have no doubt is true; also a cousin of mine, a commission merchant of the city writes me that business of every description was suspended during the old heros hero's stay ⁁ among them.
