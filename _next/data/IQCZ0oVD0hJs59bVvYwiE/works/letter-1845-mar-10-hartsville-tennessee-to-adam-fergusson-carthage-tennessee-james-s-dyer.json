I wish to make a few suggestions thro through , you to some of our friends. 1st do not understand me that I wish to run for Senate or Congress_ for my business & situation of my family for bids forbids that I should be absent long enough to take such a canvas 2nd I think Smith County should take the lead in selecting a man. If Dr Doctor Robinson will not run, Col Colonel Guild has as much management in conducting a canvas as any one we can start. Boddie is more popular in Smith but his health forbids his running. His manner suits the occasion better than Guilds. Dr Robinson can get the Democratic vote of this county. Had you not better have a convention before we do. 3rdly _ We ought not to nominate a candidate for Congress. We are in the minority and on a fair ma t ch race cant succeed.
