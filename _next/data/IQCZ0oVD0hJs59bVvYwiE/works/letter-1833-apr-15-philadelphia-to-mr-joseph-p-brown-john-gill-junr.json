I cannot yet say whether this management of his will be prejudicial to Mr. West's interest. His motive for doing so has not yet developed itself but certain it is that he suffered Mr. Woods to leave the city without seeing the papers and as all his conversations on the subject were private and apart I remained in entire ignorance of what was going on untill until after Mr. Woods departure. Should you think it necessary to communicate these facts to West, it must of course be done in the strictest confidence. I am not afraid of his honour, and I think I am bound to guard against the misrepresentations that may be made to him on the subject, for whatever injury may grow out of such duplicity will of course be fathered upon me —,"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6149/canvas/6"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:6151/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6149/canvas/7","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1833 Apr. 15, Philad[elphi]a [to] Mr. Joseph P.

Brown from John Gill, Jr. In this letter, Gill asks Brown to inform him if a man by the name of James Jones had commented negatively on the character of Gill and his nephew. In his reply, Brown explains that the destitute business situation in his area has created much discord. He further explains the accusations made by Jones and others regarding Gill's character. Brown additionally remarks on business matters, and lists the names of people who have failed or retired from business.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1833-apr-15-philadelphia-to-mr-joseph-p-brown-john-gill-junr","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6149/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1833 Apr. 15, Philad[elphi]a [to] Mr. Joseph P.
