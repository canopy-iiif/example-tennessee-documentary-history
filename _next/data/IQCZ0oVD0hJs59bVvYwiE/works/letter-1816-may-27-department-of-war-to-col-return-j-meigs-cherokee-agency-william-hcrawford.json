Sir, The Senators and representatives from Tennessee , before the adjournment of Congress, presented an address to the President, urging the expediency of extinguishing the Cherokee title to the lands north of the Tennessee, within the limits of that state. As there is no game upon the lands, and I believe, no Indians settled upon it, but Col. Colonel Lowry , it would appear to be their interest to sell it for a fair consideration. By giving Lowry a present, equal to the value of his possessions, it is probable, that a purchase can be effected of all their lands to the north of the river. The President desires, that you shall make every exertion to obtain this cession at their next national council. To enable you to affect this, you are authorised authorized to give them, either by way of annuity, or to be paid at one or more payments after the ratification, the sum of Twenty thousand dollars, and to distribute presents among them to the amount of five thousand dollars; and to Lowry, the value of"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1495/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:1499/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1495/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1816 May 27, Department of War [to] Col.

It will be proper to ascertain the relative value of the lands belonging to Tennessee, compared with that in the Mississippi territory, as the state of Tennessee ought and must pay her proportion of it. Major Walker , in private conversation told me, that he thought the Cherokee nation would sell the land which we attempted to purchase last winter. It is deemed expedient to make the effort. You are therefore authorised to offer them for their claims to the lands lying west of a line to be run due south from that point on the Tennessee river which is intersected by the Eastern boundary of Madison county , to the line agreed upon by the late treaty, an annuity of six thousand dollars a year in perpetuity. Considering that the most of this land is claimed by the Chickasaws , and that there is little or no game upon it, there is some reason to believe, that this offer will not be rejected by the nation, in their grand council.
