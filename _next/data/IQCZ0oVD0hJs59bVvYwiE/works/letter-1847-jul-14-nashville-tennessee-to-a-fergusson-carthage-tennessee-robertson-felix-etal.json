Dear Sir: We have received information from different quarters within the last few days, that the Whigs are making large calculations upon the apathy prevailing in our ranks; and that they are privately organizing in all the counties to secure a full attendance of their forces at the polls. We have no doubt that our information is reliable, and it has induced us to take the liberty of suggesting to our friends the danger of being too confident of success, and the importance of taking prompt and effective steps to counteract the scheme of our opponents. We have no doubt of our strength, and if our friends are at the polls, we shall certainly gain victory; but unless our friends are at the polls, we may have to lament the result. Let us then most earnestly impress upon you the necessity of going promptly to work to see that we are not caught sleeping on our posts, when the day of trial comes. We will not suggest any plan of organization, but hope that you will, at once, consult with our friends, and devise such means as you shall deem most effective in insuring a full vote. This is the great point now to be attained, and it is rendered doubly important from the fact, that our opponents are understood to be making arrangements to profit by our supposed apathy. We believe that it is only necessary to make these suggestions to secure your cordial and prompt action in the matter. Felix Robertson A O P Nicholson E. L. Eastman G C Lorbett"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5653/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5655/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5653/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1847 Jul. 14, Nashville [Tennessee] [to] A.
