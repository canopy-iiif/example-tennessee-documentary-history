I am aware that there is much feeling and excitement in your County growing out of the case but I trust that the Law and Constitution will be regarded as paramount of the guilt or inocene innocence of these individuals I know nothing they may be inocent innocent but this is not a question that I or you or any other authority in this state is competent to decide. The simple question for my consideration is have they been charged with an offense against the Laws of North Carolina and is the evidence of this fact made to me according to law if so I have no alternative and it is equally the duty of all the arch officers of this state to do their duty You know your duty and I doubt not will perform it Yours Respectfully James C Jones"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7911/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1845 Apr. 22, Nashville, Tennessee [to] Washington County Sheriff / James Jones : page 2"]},"width":3536,"height":4419,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7910~datastream~JP2/full/442,552/0/default.jpg","width":442,"height":552,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7910~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1/page/tdh:7910","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1/page/tdh:7910/656b684ea84c5","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7910~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3536,"height":4419,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7910~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"Papers in the case of the demand of the gov governor of North Carolina of AC Collins and others"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7909/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7910/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7909/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/tdh","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7909","label":{"en":["[Letter] 1845 Apr. 22, Nashville, Tennessee [to] Washington County Sheriff / James Jones"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/subject/tennessee-governor-1841-1845-jones.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/place/undefined.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/format/correspondence.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/date/april-22-1845.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"[Letter] 1845 Apr. 22, Nashville, Tennessee [to] Washington County Sheriff / James Jones - Untitled","description":"This document is a letter dated April 22, 1845 from the governor of Tennessee, James Jones to the sheriff of Washington County, located in Northeast Tennessee.
