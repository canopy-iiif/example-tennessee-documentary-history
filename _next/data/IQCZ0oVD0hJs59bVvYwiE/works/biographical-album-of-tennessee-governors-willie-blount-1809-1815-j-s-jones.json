William Blount , which position he held until Tennessee ceased to be a territory, 1796 . When the State was organized he was elected by the Legislature one of the Superior Judges. Blount was elected three times Governor with practically no opposition. His administration covered one of the most important periods in the history of the State. During this time, 1813 , General Jackson , with his Tennessee volunteers, fought the war with the Creek Indians . To equip these soldiers, Gov. Governor Blount raised $370,000 on his own responsibility. The battle of New Orleans was fought the last year of his term of office, January 8, 1815 . The establishment of the Supreme Court, and the beginning of the State Bank System, also belong to this period. Blount was a member of the Constitutional Convention 1835 . He died Sept. September 10, 1835 .
