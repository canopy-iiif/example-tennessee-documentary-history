This is indeed a most gratifying result and we trust that a short time will witness the completion of this great work of internal improvement. The charter however in its present shape presents difficulties which must to a great extent delay its progress if not totally defeat its Successful prosecution. The Stock has been taken in full confidence that this defeat would be remedied by the Legislature at the first opportunity The object of this communication therefore is most respectfully and most earnestly to request your Excellency to bring this charter before the coming called session of the Legislature for such amendments as may be needed. If this should be done then need be no delay in the prosecution of this important enterprise. This request would probably have come more properly from the directory. but the time of their election and organization the 17th Inst Instant will be too late The trust that our application will not be considered as ill timed, as we look upon it as a work of great consequence"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7710/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7713/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7710/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1836 Sep 1, Athens, Tennessee [to] Newton Cannon, Nashville, Tennessee / A.M.
