The movement, I apprehend, will secure the conscience of a large and respectable portion of the people. Those who advocate it do so on the ground that we have been deprived of our Senator. A writer in the Knoxville Tribune of last week goes so far as to say that the Whigs of this end of the State will not support any person but an East Tennessean for that office.
