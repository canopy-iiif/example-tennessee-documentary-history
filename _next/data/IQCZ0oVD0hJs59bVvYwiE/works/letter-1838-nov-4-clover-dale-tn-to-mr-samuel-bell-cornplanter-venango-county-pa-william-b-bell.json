This has been a very bad year on Iron masters, the summer and fall has been so remarkably dry that the furnaces had to lay idle for the want of water. I have Just finished getting in our corn, although it has been very much injured by the drought, we have housed about one hundred and thirty barrels, our wheat and oats crops were very good.

I have sowed fifteen acres in wheat this year, which looks very flourishing at present. There is such a quantity of fruit on the chest-nut and oak trees this year that it will fatten the hogs without the assistance of corn, but there is one evil attending large fruit years, the hogs become very wild and have to be hunted with dogs and shot like you would a deer. Tell Wylie , and Theodore that I wish they had been here this fall to gather chestnuts, as they were very plenty. It was with deep regret that I heard of Miss Gormly 's low state of health, and knowing her worth I sympathize with you all, you have parted with many of your friends, and I think you ought not to grieve for them as those who have no hope.
