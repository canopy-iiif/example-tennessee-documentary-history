Cousin Sam let me read your letter, that he received last week he laughed at me very much about the kiss that you sent or at least in trying to get it. The Examination commenced on yesterday morning which was Friday & will continue until Tuesday evening today and tomorrow omitted of course. The lower classes only, were examined yesterday. The more advanced are reserved for the two last days. I think that I am very well prepared I have two very pretty peices pieces of music to play at the Concert.
