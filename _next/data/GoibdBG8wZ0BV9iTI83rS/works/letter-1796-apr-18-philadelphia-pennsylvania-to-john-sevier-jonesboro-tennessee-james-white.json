I congratulate you, in either case. For, if the united states should be of opinion that a census taken without their concurrence should be invalid; yet I have a strong confidence that you will be commissioned, & paid as an officer of the United States: at least, your friends, here, will push it in your favor; & I make no doubt will succeed. They have been looking for the latter case, because it is perceivable that it is a matter of some doubt whether for fear, of the precedent, it may not be policy in this Government to have some share in the census. For my own part I think it a great point for us that the Governor of our Territory should be a man who is decidedly the choice of the people. I mention thing in confidence to you as something questionable: I rather hope, & expect that our Government of Tennessee will be allowed to proceed on the plan established by our convention: particularly as the committee appointed to consider on the case, in the House of Representatives have made a favorable report. The Senate, have also appointed a Committee for the consideration of the same subject; but the latter, I am told, will be clear that a census in which Congress had no share ought not to be looked upon as valid. The question will be taken up in the course of the work, & as soon as decided shall be sent you, for your information. I thought it an act of friendship to inform You of the true state of the business; but as I have no certain grounds on which to found an opinion, I wish this loose surmise to be to yourself in Confidence Mero"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7399/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1796 Apr. 18, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania, to] John Sevier, Jonesboro, Tennessee / James White : page 2"]},"width":3240,"height":3896,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7398~datastream~JP2/full/405,487/0/default.jpg","width":405,"height":487,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7398~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/1/page/tdh:7398","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/1/page/tdh:7398/656b67d0c7ce6","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7398~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3240,"height":3896,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7398~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7396/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"There is nothing new, here.
