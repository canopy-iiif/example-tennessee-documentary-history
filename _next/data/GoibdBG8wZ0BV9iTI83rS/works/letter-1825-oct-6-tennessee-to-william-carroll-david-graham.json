making in the whole fifty five tracts: The quantity contained in each tract is not specially designated but from a measurement of the lines by the scale laid down they seem generally to include about 640 acres each__ From the plans deposited in my office it does not appear that any school lands were laid down by the Surveyors of the First, Fourth, fifth, or Sixth districts, nor by the surveyor of the district south of French Broad & Holston The plan of the Hiwassee district belonging to my office, has in obedience to a Resolution of the General assembly been delivered to the Entry taker of that district, & there is no document now within my power from which the number of school tracts in that district could be made known.____ Respectfully submitted, David Graham"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7260/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1825 Oct. 6 [Tennessee, to William] Carroll / David Graham : page 2"]},"width":3978,"height":3022,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7259~datastream~JP2/full/497,378/0/default.jpg","width":497,"height":378,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7259~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1/page/tdh:7259","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1/page/tdh:7259/656b67ad65d86","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7259~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3978,"height":3022,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7259~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"From the Secy Secretary of State Laid on the table 13th oct"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7258/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7259/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7258/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/tdh","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A7258","label":{"en":["[Letter] 1825 Oct. 6 [Tennessee, to William] Carroll / David Graham"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/subject/law-and-legislation.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/place/tennessee.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/format/correspondence.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/date/october-6-1825.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"[Letter] 1825 Oct. 6 [Tennessee, to William] Carroll / David Graham - Untitled","description":"This is a letter from David Graham to Governor William Carroll, dated October 6, 1825.
