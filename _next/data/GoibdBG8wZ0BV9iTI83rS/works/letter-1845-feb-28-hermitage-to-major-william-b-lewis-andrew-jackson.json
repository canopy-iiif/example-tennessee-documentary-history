It was this, that Col Colonel Laughlin had went on to Washington had bought on interest in the Madisonian, and expected to make it the organ of the administration This if true would be one of the most fatal steps for Col Colonel Polk that could be taken — it would be placing him in the shoes of Mr Tyler , and Laughlin travelling on with the Col Colonel to Washington would place Col Colonel Polk under the implication of taking him on there for the purpose which I am sure was not the case. Common sense will at once shew show the evil consequences that struck to Col Colonel Polk, to put himself in the attitude of providing Mr Tyler for the succession — It would split the democracy to pieces, and redouned to the great injury of Polks administration — I love from the moment I heard it put my face against it, & hope I have checked this inconsiderable movement — I hope there is not truth in the rumor— if there is, there is less common sense in the movers than I calculated upon, let me hear from you.
