Having no information of the extent of the examination which the Engineers are directed to make I am somewhat at a loss how to instruct you on the subject I shall however State what I conceive to be the wishes of Tennessee in relation to the matters leaving it with you to inforce enforce her claims, not doubting but that you will accomplish all that can be effected. In the Eastern section of the State it is desired and expected, that the road from the Virginia line through the counties of Sullivan Hawkins and Granger passing through Rogersville and Rutledge to Knoxville shall be examined, as well as the road through the counties of Carter Washington Green , Cocke and Jefferson to Knoxville. From Knoxville to Kingston , the best and I believe the only good route is along the main stage road From the latter place it is very desirable, that a survey should be made not only along the new road that has lately been run by commissioners on the part of this State to sparta , thence along the Stage road by way of McMinnville , Winchester and Salem"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7269/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1825 Nov. 17, Murfreesboro, Tennessee [to] Newton Cannon, Murfreesboro, Tennessee / W[illia]m Carroll : page 2"]},"width":3239,"height":4083,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7268~datastream~JP2/full/405,510/0/default.jpg","width":405,"height":510,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7268~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/1/page/tdh:7268","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/1/page/tdh:7268/656b67ad5c1a9","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7268~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3239,"height":4083,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:7268~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7266/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"to Huntsville , but also through the counties of Rhea and Hamilton along the main road down what is called the Tennessee valley crossing the Tennessee river at Browns ferry, so as to admit the direct continuence continuance of the route in Alabama through Well's Valley There is an other route in the examination of which West Tennessee feels very deeply interested. Many are impressed with a belief that the great national road from Washington city South Westward should terminate at some point on the mississippi river , near the mouth of big Hatchee river If it is inconvenient for the Engineers to make the latter Survey on their way to New Orleans you will indeavour endeavour to prevail on them to do so as they return to Washington city. It is understood that the Engineers are instructed to make a survey of a route along which a canal would have to pass connecting the waters of the Hiwassee with those of the Coosa . To this subject so essential to the commerce of the Eastern part of the State your attention will be particularly directed. It will be proper for you to keep a Journal of the routes examined, noticing the quality of the land through which they pass- the elevation of the principal hills__ water courses and the convenience of materials for the construction of good turn pike roads.
