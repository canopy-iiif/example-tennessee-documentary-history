I'll I will tell what I think will cure her (or at least it cured me) On my chill days Cousin Elen made me lie in bed all Day take Quinine every half hour and a Wine Glass of Toddy every half hour. I did not want to take so much but they made me. Its true that It made my head very dizzy. but that was nothing compared with being well. Do tell her to try it. perhaps it will do her some good. Tell her that she must come up Christmas any how. I wish you would tell Aunt Butter that she must excuse me for writing that very short letter to her on Aunt N. paper . She must answer it soon.
