The last summer was very dry in this country & corn crops were not generally good but the late rains made generally very good crops of cotton. The last winter was the severest that I have seen in this country & the early part of spring very wet & we are now suffering for the want of the rain. I have nothing to say on political subjects only that our State does not go with South Carolina in its nullifying policy; although most of our Citizens think the tariff of the United States is oppression in the Southern section of the Union, but they still think it a small evil compared to civil war with its accompanying horrors. Please give our most affectionate respects to my aged Mother, Brothir Brother & Sistir Sister Anderson & accept them for yourself & family, remember us affectionately to Aunt Duffill and all our relatives in your section of country. Please to write as often as convenient you know the difficulty that I labour labor under in writing from my hand being crippled, but you could write frequently. I remain with respect your affectionate brother Wm William Brown"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6208/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:6209/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6208/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/tdh","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6208","label":{"en":["[Letter] 1831 June 1 Near Woodville [to] Joseph Brown / William Brown"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/subject/tennessee-politics-and-government-to-1865.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/place/tennessee.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/format/correspondence.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/api/facet/date/june-1-1831.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"[Letter] 1831 June 1 Near Woodville [to] Joseph Brown / William Brown - Untitled","description":"Untitled","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1831-june-1-near-woodville-to-joseph-brown-william-brown","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A6208/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1831 June 1 Near Woodville [to] Joseph Brown / William Brown"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
