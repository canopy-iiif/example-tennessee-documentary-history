I have now the satisfaction to announce to your Excellency the fact that two of the most respectable of these nations_ namely- the Delawares and Shawnees , have positively refused to comply with the invitation of the Cherokees to attend the council; and that these nations have assigned for their non-attendance the very prudent reason that the cherokees, in their invitation had failed to explain to the nations invited, the object of the intended council.
