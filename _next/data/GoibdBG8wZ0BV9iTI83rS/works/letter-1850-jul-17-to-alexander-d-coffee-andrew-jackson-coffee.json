I am of the opinion that you have done a wise thing to embark your fortune in the line of business you have now adopted, and more especially as it will seperate separate you from the Hutchings place, and has given you your own home . When you first went to live at the plantation I thought ‚ÅÅ it a wise thing, and one that would benefit both parties, but I not long after that event changed my opinion, especially as to the benefit to accrue to yourself, and would have freely advised you on the subject, but for two reasons. One was my own unsuccessfull unsuccessful career up to that time, and the other, the Coolness that grew up about that time between us. I am convinced that you would have done better on your own hook, and you would have been saved much anxiety &c et cetera Well it is now over and you have embarked in an interesting and safe business; with industrious and rising men, and I have no doubt you will be very successfull successful"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8713/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8717/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8713/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1850 Jul. 17 [to] Alex[ander D.

And in that case you can have no backing out, although it is an office that will bring only trouble to you. I think Sis ought to keep the guardianship in her own hands and employ the property for John's benefit as seems best, she will then know that she has done what she believed to be best, and John will surely be content with his Mothers management of the property she gave him, On the other hand, You will know Sis is not at all times reasonable, and from evidences John has shown of his disposition I should say he will not be unlike his mother in that respect, therefore you have no guarentee guarantee that either will be satisfied with your management, and if you once take hold you ought not, to please them, at any future time resign the trust, and in that event bitterness will arise of the severest cast.
