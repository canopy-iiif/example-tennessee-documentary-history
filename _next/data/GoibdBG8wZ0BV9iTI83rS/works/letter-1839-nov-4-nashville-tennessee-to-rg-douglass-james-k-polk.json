Esquire Sir, Your letter of the 14th ult ultimo has been received. The certificate of the Director of the Gallatin and Cumberland Turnpike Company which you enclose is deficient in not specifying the amount actually paid in by the Stockholders. The certificate Sets forth \"that stock to the amount of two thousand dollars has been paid to the Treasurer of said company\", but does not state whether it be in addition to the amount previously paid in or not. By reference to the act of 1838 ch chapter 107 Sec Section 23 you will see what is required in order to authorize the issuance of Bonds of the state in such cases. The certificate required by the act cannot be too full and explicit. When the requisitions of the law are complied with the Bonds will be promptly issued.
