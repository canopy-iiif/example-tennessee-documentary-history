I received a letter from the Governor of Tennessee approbating the measure, & requesting me to correspond with the Generals Jackson , Cocke , & White commanding the Tennessee troops; in the meantime the the leading young Cherokee Chiefs were enrolling their young men for the expedition and applied to me for Blankets & some other articles of Cloathing Clothing to enable those who were destitute to march with them in co.operation with our troops. there was no time to consult the war Department. there was no time to hessitate hesitate ; the frontiers were menaced with a formidable savage force, become so only by their desperation we have nothing to fear while we estimate the utmost they can do. in this kind of war it was considered that the service of the Cherokees would be of great value & I furnished the most needy whose names were enrolled at that time with articles of Cloathing to the amount of ten dollars each: not as a gift, or present; but to"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1663/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:1667/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1663/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1813 Oct. 30, Highwassee Garrison [to John Armstrong] / [Return J.
