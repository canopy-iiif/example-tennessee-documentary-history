May 20, 1775. In addition to these I have collected other evidence in confirmation of the same transaction_ And have also obtained the signatures of many of the signees to the Declaration_ An enthusiastic admirer of that lofty spirit of freedom & Independence which glowed in the bosoms & animated the deliberations of that Patriotic Convention I wish to rescue from comparative oblivion so briliant brilliant an event in the early history of our Country. One method of affecting this is to arrange the principal resolutions of that convention in a condensed form to which will be affixed the names of the members_ The accompanying manuscript will best illustrate the plan I had conceived_ I would also prefer that the names of those whose signatures I have been able to obtain should appear in their as they usually subscribed them but as you suggested that our artists were unable to execute full similes, that part might be omitted. I have thought that Horaces aese perenning should be either prefixed or appended to the declaration. If an obelisk or any such figure were on the sheet these words might be placed on its base_ But the execution I leave chiefly to yourself _ But I wish you to spare no pains in making it worthy of the eventful transaction it is intended to perpetuate_ The vellum and satin I will furnish _ Let me first see a plan of the piece (on which I will give you my opinion) accompanied with any remarks you think proper about the number I should have struck_ the price &c and et cetera . Very Respectfully yours &c J. G. M. Ramsey. F. S.
