I rode in Town an hour this - morning expecting to see mr Mister williams he has not got home yet. he has lost his - election and Rogers is States attorney. I have no doubt it will be to his advantage greatly, but is it as note a compliment to the judgement and intelligence of the legislature of Tennessee . we have most delightful weather again. and I enjoy it highly mr Mister Ballard has made your pens as you directed. and has put 24 hogs - they will nearly get in the corn off the ground for the wheat this week it is turning out very well. I am going to have company to night. ( Dr Doctor warren and wife and brother Taylor.) and have not time to write you a longer letter. as I have a few things to attend to. and it is getting in the afternoon and my letter must be sent in early.
