I was truly gratified to hear something from yourself, sister Catharine and the rest of the family, as they are sources from which I have been anxiously expecting to hear for some time past. Since your letter Came to hand I have made considerable enquiry among the mirchants merchants of this place in order to learn when they intend going to the east for their goods Many of them have already gone, Viz Messrs. Jackson , Dickenson , Armstrong and Gaines ; and I can hear of no one else who intends going on before about the middle of March. Mr. G. M. Hayen will leave here about that time; but as he will be in Considerable haste I expect he will take the stage from this place. In fact I have heard of no one going any other way as they all wish to perform the trip as soon as possible.
