He was born June 7, 1809, near Nashville ; was educated for the law, but became a farmer on account of his health. Without political ambition, Jones was induced to run for the Legislature 1839, and was elected to the Lower House. He developed such strength as a campaign speaker that he was chosen as elector on Whig ticket 1840. This brought him into prominence and 1841 he was the unanimous choice of the Whigs for Governor. His campaign against Polk , the Democratic candidate, has become memorable as the origin of modern political \"stump\" speaking. With wit and humorous stories he completely swept aside the logical arguments of his opponent, and gave the people a campaign of good humor. He was elected by a vote of 53,586 to 50,343. 1843 he defeated Polk the second time. Among the important acts of his administration was the selection of Nashville as the permanent capital of the State, 1843, and the beginning of the erection of the present Capitol. 1848 Jones headed the electorial ticket of the State for Taylor and Filmore and 1851 was elected to U.S. Senate where he served until 1857.
