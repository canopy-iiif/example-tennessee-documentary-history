I have had prepared & here enclose the necessary forms to obtain them. If you concur with me is this opinion, please have these papers filled up & returned to me & I will at once place them before the Department. I presume it will make no difference that you may have previously made requisition for the ordinary arms. if you should see proper to charge it in whole or part for these pistols.
