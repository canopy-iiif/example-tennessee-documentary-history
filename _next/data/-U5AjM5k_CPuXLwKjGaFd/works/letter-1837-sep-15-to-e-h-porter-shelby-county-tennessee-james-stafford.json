The harvests in the more northern parts of the state were excellent. The corn is very good thro. throughout the state Improvements of all sorts are going on with great rapidity.

Reinhardt has not acknowledged it until the 8th of July . I cannot see what right they had to the use of $300.00 of my money for six months. I have heard of the fall of Mr Edmonson of Paris . If you have the paper in which he is published, I would like you to send it to me. In the midst of the sickness and mortality that has prevailed in your town, I am glad your family have escaped. I have been from home for 5 months, with the exception of calling & staying a few days 3 or 4 times. My agency is now nearly out, and I design to spend the winter at home.
