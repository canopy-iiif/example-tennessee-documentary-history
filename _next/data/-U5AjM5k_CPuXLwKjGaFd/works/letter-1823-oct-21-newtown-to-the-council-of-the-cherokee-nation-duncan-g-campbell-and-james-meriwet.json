Campbell and James Meriwether, and dated October 21, 1823. The commissioners patronizingly explain the relationship between the United States government and the Cherokee people and attempt to rationalize the continued efforts to acquire Cherokee lands. They insist that it is unfair that the Cherokees possess more land than they can physically occupy and thereby attempt to justify the intrusions of overzealous frontier settlers.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-tennessee-documentary-history/works/letter-1823-oct-21-newtown-to-the-council-of-the-cherokee-nation-duncan-g-campbell-and-james-meriwet","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A479/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"[Letter] 1823 Oct. 21.
