The removal by land with unavoidable exposure and fatigue will require at least Seventy days; the choice of way is, however, given to the emigrant. The places of Rendezvous will be the Agency, Ross' Landing and a point opposite Bellefonte , at each of which places the Boats will stop to take in Emigrants. The Superintendent takes this occasion to repeat that he has been instructed by their great Father the President to treat the Cherokees with kindness and friendship, and to assure them that to linger in the midst of a white population, suffering oppression and encroachment, ruin and extermination must inevitably fall on them. In tenderness then to their persons and interests, he would urge them in the most friendly manner, assuring them at the same time that the Treaty will not be altered, to make speedy preparation, settle their business with the Commissioners, and remove before the 23rd. of May , when the time arrives for the application of Military Force.
