Dr. Butler 's reply to Governor Gilmer . Haweis , June 7, 1831 To his Excellency George R. Gilmer , Governor of Georgia . Sir, A few days since, I received a communication purporting to be from your excellency Suffer me to say, I was not a little surprised at some ideas that communication contained. It is due to the cause in which I am engaged, definitely and concisely to state the object of my residence in the Cherokee nation of Indians. My sole object in commencing my residence among this people, more than ten years since, was to assist the government of the United States in promoting the civilization and Christianization of the Cherokees . I have, during my life, studiously avoided all connection or interference with political affairs, and more particularly since my residence among this people. Since living among them, I have invariably pursued that course of conduct, which I conceived would tend most for their spiritual good. Though I may have been accused of being \" a mortal enemy to Georgia and her measures,\" I solemnly affirm I am not, although I could not in conscience subscribe to all her enactments. For instance, I could not take the oath required of white men who reside in her chartered"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/628/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:630/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/628/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter], 1831 June 7, Haweis [Mission, Cherokee Nation] to George R.

I cannot change my religious views, or general religious conduct, with the various political changes of the times. It is what neither your excellency nor any other person can expect. Rather than change my religious views, to meet the exigencies of political affairs, permit me to say, I should sacrifice my life.
