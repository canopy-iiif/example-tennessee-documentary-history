I found Adelaide and the children in perfect health, and the girls also. They have grown very much, you would not know the girls. I wrote Butler on my arrival here, and awaited for him one week, whin when I became somewhat impatient, I then went in search of him, and after two days hard riding I found him. He had met with an accident which had prevented him from attending to business for some months and had two weeks prior to my arrival, engaged with a gentleman by the month. I told him and the gentleman that it was actually necessary for him to leave in a few days, — he told me he would try so to do on monday that was on Thursday, and that he would be up on Monday the same day, in the Steamboat, but here it is near that day week and I have not seen or heard from him since. He seems to be anxious to go out, and says James is determined to leave Virginia this fall. I wrote Richard to come up with Mary as soon as possible, so I could fix her, by the time Butler was ready but I have not as yet heard of or seen him. Our family are the most stupid and tardy species of creation His conduct here was of ⁁ the cast you and myself judged it be.
