You intimated an apology for writing on fools cap paper, this was unnecessary, for I would that all the communications that I receive were were were spread out on these lengthy sheets, containing every variety of news calculated to call up fond apreciation appreciation , for it is nearly a luxury to the student's mind wearied down by clasic classic studies on metaphisical metaphysical sciences to have his attention diverted from these continuous themes, and indulge his thoughts in contemplating the happy scenes about his indeared endeared home. You perceive that I have followed your example in my selection of lecter lecture pa paper, not that I have so much to write but for another reason that will manifest itself in the sequel, For, for the life of me I dont know what to write that would interest or amuse you.

Though heavy frost this morning has whitened our mountain tops.
