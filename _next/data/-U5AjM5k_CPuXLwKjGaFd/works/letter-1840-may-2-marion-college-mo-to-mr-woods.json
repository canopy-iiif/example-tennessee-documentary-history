Our college vacation of six weeks has terminated, I wished very much to have visited Nashville during the vacation, but a variety of hindrances prevented me. My health had declined very much, and the College could not advance, or rather pay what would be necessary for my expenses. I found I could not bring on my child if I was otherwise able, as it is not yet weaned , although it is old enough. All these things were against my contemplated visit. I should be extremely happy to have my child under the maternal care of Mrs. Woods , especially if I could live in Nashville myself, where I could frequently see it. There is no prospect of employ in Nashville at present, and I shall therefore have to remain where I am for the present. Perhaps in the fall vacation I may have it in my power to visit Nashville, and I shall endeavor ⁁ to effect it. My main and principal source of anxiety and regret is that I have not been able to liquidate the debt I owe you.

The Marion City Company are yet indebted to me upwards of $500, which I intend to sue for. It can be recovered from the members of that company as individuals, each under obligations to pay. To give you one instance how much I suffered by my connexion connection with that company, I was twice attacked with the billious bilious fever while engaged in the surveys of the Company, brought on by exposure. The physicians bills amounted alone to nearly $150. All these trials and losses however would be nothing if I had my health as in former years, but I believe my constitution is quite broken. I could easily pay off all my debts (and yours is the only one of importance that I owe) if I could collect what is due me here. Notwithstanding I trust I shall be able to get clear of all debts in the course of a year at least. My salary is $1000 per an. annual and my expenses at present are light. I deem it due to you thus to state my circumstances for various reasons which I need hardly mention. Little Lucretia is growing finely, she has excellent health and spirits. She is just beginning to walk. I believe I mentioned in my last that her nurse is living in my house, and I board in her family.
