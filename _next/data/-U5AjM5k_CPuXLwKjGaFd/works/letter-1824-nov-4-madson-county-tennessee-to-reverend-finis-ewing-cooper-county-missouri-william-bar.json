Tennessee Nov. November 4th 1824 -- Most dearly beloved Brother Ewing- Your very acceptable letter of the 28th of Sept September which was handed me by Bro. Brother Morrow , is now before me; It as well as many of your letters, instructs and comforts my poor heat heart ; yes; I love you, and your lett ers Though I was pleased to get a letter, from you, yet such was my disappointment in not seeing you it did me but little good at first, But since I have read it over, and over again, and again. I can truly say thank God for Breathren Brethren , and such as I so dearly love. I went to the Anderson Presley , at Princeton , in hopes of riding with you from there to Synod, O! what a feast it would have been, and Ah! what a disappointment it was when I heard you were not coming. We had by far the most harmonious Synod I ever attended; and I can truly say the most solem n communion I ever witnessed, God was there of a truth You suggested I had forgotten you, I assure you honestly you will be one of the last men on earth I will ever forget, for many reasons I feel more in debt to you than all the men on Earth, and in that case as I am with my Maker I have no doubt but I will die in solvent; O! for a filial, humble, dependant head I was pleased with your young men, who came to synod, particularly with Bro. Wieden , he came home with me, and preached for us, he is a sensible, agreeable Man, and an excelent excellent preacher; I wish the world had many more such in it. You wished to know how I liked my country, & so for I like it very well, there has been but little sickenss, my own family has had good health except Libby's two daughters had the Agree a few weeks, ---- The soil is good, the climate pleasant, and the water is fine, I hope we can live religious here, and it is as near from her to Heaven, when we die as from any Country Thank you for your care towards me, lest a Bail Bale of Cotton get crossways on my heart, if this were the case it could not so well rise to God; I will have four, or five bails, But I hope God will keep them off my heart, do pray for me."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5621/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1824 Nov. 4, Madson County, Ten[nessee] [to] Rev[erend] Finis Ewing, Cooper County, Missouri / W[illia]m Barnett : page 2"]},"width":3211,"height":5109,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5620~datastream~JP2/full/401,639/0/default.jpg","width":401,"height":639,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5620~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1/page/tdh:5620","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1/page/tdh:5620/656b65ebd8deb","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5620~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3211,"height":5109,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5620~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"You wish to know, who were the prevailing Sectary here, I believe the Methodist are the most numerous, But if we had riding preachers of the right twist sufficient I have no doubt but in a short time we could under God get, keep ahead of any here. I got a Presby here, consisting of four Preachers , three of whom never will ride the circuit much. The Nashville , and Anderson Presbyteries, are to send us some young men in the spring O! that God would come with them and preside over our infant Presytery. Oh! it is easy to follow, or be lead on, in Presby, But to take the lead is too heavy for as light intelects intelects as I have, O! that God would help for his names honor. There are two old P. Preachers in this district, and they both would not make one good one We have had some good times here more than 100 have professed since I came to the country, Two of whom were Joseph Lynn's daughters and the Maj. Major himself is become very serious, Charle's wife has professed. The general asembly assembly question was stired stirred at Synod, you will see from the resolution of Synod, we could not put it off, but we baffed it, for the presant present , But I firmly believe, from the presant size, and the rapid groath growth of our body something will have to be done shortly. Either an Asembly, or alter the Constitution, and make a delegated Synod, from the inormous enormous weight of Synod even now, there was but one place nominated for next Synod, if all the members were to attend with there their Elders next fall I fear we would have to draft a place for the next, I do wish you would write me your views fully on the subject, as I am at a loss to know which would tend to the most good, and least harm, and as each Presby, is to report to next Synod whether we will continue as we are; have an assembly or delegate Synod the former of which would be my choice but it seems impractable impractical and which of the two latter I would thank you to tell me, and send your reasons why, and wherefore, if you please. I think the plan that would most effectually mix & unite the Breathren, so as to continue a oneness in Doctrine practice &c &c would be best, my mind has rather leaned to a delegated Synod, as the Bond of Union, But to be honest I do confess I am so Ignorant I do not know which is best, I hear Men on no greater minds ( perhapse perhaps ) than I say and they appear to be clear that this or that, way is for the best, But how they know, is the question, It is to me, a deep, and dark thing"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5620/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/2","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1824 Nov. 4, Madson County, Ten[nessee] [to] Rev[erend] Finis Ewing, Cooper County, Missouri / W[illia]m Barnett : page 3"]},"width":3215,"height":5103,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5619~datastream~JP2/full/402,638/0/default.jpg","width":402,"height":638,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5619~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/2/page/tdh:5619","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/2/page/tdh:5619/656b65ed1e8e2","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5619~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3215,"height":5103,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:5619~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/2"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/2/annopage-2","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5617/canvas/2/annopage-2/annotation-2","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"As it respects your Lecturs Lectures , they have been shamefully neglected by individuals, much to the mortifycation mortification of Synod; a Resolution passed securing to Synod; a right of publish all Books wherein our denomination is particularly concerned, and the profits arising shall belong to the Synod, and subject to her control Such as your Lecturs, Confessions, Hymn Books &c et cetera &c &c John Barnett , A.
