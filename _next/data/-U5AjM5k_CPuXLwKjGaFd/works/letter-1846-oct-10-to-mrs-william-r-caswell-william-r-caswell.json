Major Brookins Campbell , from Washington County , arrived here yesturday yesterday evening, direct from Tennessee , by way of Nashville - My first question to him, was to ascertain how your health was and athough although he could give me no direct answer to my interrogatories upon this subject, yet I derived much comfort from my cross examination of him, and Mr. Royston who came with him - They said they did not hear particularly how you was but merely that all were well - this of course was no satisfaction but they said they saw Eliza , in a carriage with Mary , returning from a visit to Ann in Knoxville , & from this I infered inferred your health must have materially improved, or Eliza would not have left you. - And I could only guess, whether you was at home or not - They saw my Mother at Nashville, she was on a visit to Mrs. Foster , who was very sick - My mother sent me a very fine black silk cravat, and ⁁ 2 pairs of Lambs - wool socks - James Nichol wrote to me, that Ma had heard from you, and that you was very well. I expect it was about such information as I received thro' through Majr. C. Major Campbell I have only received one letter from you (and that was by Lieut. Lieutenant Turnley ) Since I left home. I suppose my letters have been sent to San Antonio . - If I had recd. received them I should have had many of my anxious conjectures explained, relative to your heath health & comfort, relative to Eliza, to our little boy - to your Ma, & Mary, Alfred , Henry , Ann & our family, our servants, our neighbours neighbors - & c et cetera - What has become of Thos. Thomas M. Anderson - If he is at home - tell him to write me all the little neighbourhood neighborhood news - and direct his letter to \" Captain Wm. R William Richard . Caswell \" \" Care of Brig. Gen. Brigadier General Pillow .\" \" Hd Irs. 2nd Brigade. U.S.A United States of America \". \" Mexico \"- And so you can direct your letters; But I cannot tell where our Head Quarters may be when a letter will reach me from home, after you receive this.. I have calculated that the war would now be ended without any more fighting, but our negotiations must proceed slowly, and that therefore I shall be delayed some time yet in my return home -"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/156/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:160/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/156/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1846 Oct. 10 [to] Mrs. W[illia]m R.
