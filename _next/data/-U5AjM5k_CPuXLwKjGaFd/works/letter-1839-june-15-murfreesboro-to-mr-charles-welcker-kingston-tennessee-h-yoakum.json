The examination took place two days since, and went off with great eclat. The next session will commence about the 15th of July. Perhaps you may not be out of the notion of sending them. Write us upon this point; and also to give us the news of your country. We have nothing here, more than what is common with yourselves_ a high political excitement, which will abate in August. The prospect of a glorious triumph of Democracy is bright. How is it with you? The health of our place is very fine this summer. Evaline sends her respects to yourself and best compliments to Caroline, in which I join her, barely adding, that I am Yr. Your friend. H.
