I intended to have written you long since, but have been so engaged in business, when my health would admit permit , since we returned home, that I have not done one half of what I should have done, in the way of letter writing. In relation to your Pile Ointment, I must say, I believe it will cure any ordinary case of piles, if used agreeably to the directions, but mine have been of so long standing, I doubt a permanent cure being affected, yet I have derived great benefit from the use of your ointment, more, far more, than from any prepartion preparation I have ⁁ ever used, & I believe I have used every preparation, I ever heard of, commencing at last Sixteen years ago. — I consider your Pills inferior to none.
