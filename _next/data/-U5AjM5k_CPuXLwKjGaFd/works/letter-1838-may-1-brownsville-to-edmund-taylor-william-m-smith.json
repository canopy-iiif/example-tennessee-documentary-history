Julia is anxious to see you all, and I can probably spare the horses better next week that at any other time I race We may not be able to Come, but I think it probable we shall. Julia's health is about the Same, perhaps a little better. The rest are well. We had heard nothing of Bettie's marrying notions, until Veny's letter came, which was the day after the wedding Tell Veny that Jane Claiborne and Henry Johnson (brother of Bob ) were married Thursday.
