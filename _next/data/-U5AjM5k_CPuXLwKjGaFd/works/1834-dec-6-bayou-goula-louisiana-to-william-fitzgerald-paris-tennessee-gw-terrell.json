Fitzgerald After I wrote you in the summer and received your answer I requested capt captain saml Samuel to make some exchange with you, if it could be done, to get the girl Polly back, as she belongs to a family of negroes I yet have, but I have heard nothing about the result and know nothing about what has been done about it, or whether any thing. I saw Dewitt a few days since in Vicksburg , he told me that he had sent his family to Paris , and that he had sent along with them a pair of horses belonging to me. As I can not raise the money to pay the balance of the notes you endorsed for me, I have concluded to apprise you that the horses are mine, and that you may sell them to pay the debt, as far as they will go. They are a pair of handsome grey horses- (Saml knows them) and as good a pair of carriage horses as are in the state. All I ask is that you will make the most you can out of them, which I know you will do. I have refused $500 for then repeatedly- but do not expect they will command it in your market. Take whatever measures may be necessary to get them into possession, should there be any difficulty about it. Dewitt has no earthly claim to them-- I only loaned them to him, to carry his family to Texas , but as he is not going there with them, I want you to get the benefit of them, as I cannot raise the money to relieve you."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5354/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5357/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5354/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["1834 Dec. 6, Bayou Goula, L[ouisian]a [to] W[illia]m Fitzgerald, Paris, Tennessee / G.W.
