Ross , OK Park Hill , Okla Oklahoma - Aug 23, 1929 Here at the Fort, Jan. 5, 1838 . John Ross , Dear Friend: I will now let you know how our country is going. The other day I wrote you a letter and told you of several families had left Oojalunuhi Captain now there are several different families are here now Woowastiyula Captain and the other one Oodatiyulino Captain . They gather them up at Galoliyi and I will tell you this, three or four days ago Captain Aniyosgi Captain, he stays at Usdanali and he said this: Do you want to hear what John Ross and Mayseen talked about? I said , Yes. I want to hear what they said. All right, they now then they will read their letters to you. And they began to read first letter which they wrote to Mayseen . When he got through the first letter he began to read the other letter. The next letter he read was the answer from Mayseen . The last letter you wrote to Mayseen and they read that also. Also he read a letter from War Department, Captain of the soldiers gave them orders to approve treaty. When he got through reading the letter he further said this: John Ross has resigned his work. He said this to them: \"This is last time I have written for you, therefore the War Department authorized to approve the treaty and the Cherokees to get ready to go down the river and what little property they have to sell it quick as they can. They will have to leave. If they are not ready to leave in time to leave May 25 I will have my soldiers and they may have to spill blood. That is what I have to do according to my orders, although I don't want one Indian's single hair to fall to the ground. Therefore I want you to notify them to get ready to leave and you are the vice president. You are responsible to notify your people. He asked me if I was going to notify the Captain of the soldiers. I answered and said this: I will not do that. I will not do this until the delegates come. John Ross will notify us what to do. He said this: I am satisfied he will say to move out. Hurry and tell them to move out. Georgia is their country and now the Indians cannot make their home there. They will have to move out as quick as they can. If they stay there to the time of the treaty, what little property they have, white people will steal what they got. Then I cannot do anything for them unless my own tribe have a battle. and he said, You will have to notify your people. I said this: I wont do that. I haven't received no letter yet. I think I will get a letter to the effect. He said this-- he told me this: What you have heard if just like he was sitting in front of you. He has written you. He has written you and heard what he has said.\" He told me that they may be back already. Usdali , that was John Ross 's Company. That is all we said and he went away. And this land we thought we might save it. We have heard and the people in our Country have heard that and had hopes. White people was sorry to hear that. But we have heard afterwards that you have failed to do us any good. Now the Cherokees are very sorry and some have got no hope making a crop this coming spring and the white people are very glad. That is all I have to tell. There is lots of talk going on but I cannot tell it all. I want you to write me a letter. I want to hear from you and hear how you are getting along and what is going on. I will let you know. I am well, also my folks.
