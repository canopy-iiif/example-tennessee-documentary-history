I am sorry the visit to the springs did not improve Margarets health. As to Mothers being \"desolate since I left.\" I would write to her, but I think I will comfort her by my presence before a great while, for I would not live in this town for any consideration, there is ⁁ less sociability here than any place I ever was in, there is no place that you can get among the gentle men of the place but at the grocery, there you will find people of every class, and every age from the boy of ten years old to the old man of seventy, all drink, young & old, play cards, tell vulgar anecdotes, and vice in every shape may be seen, and that too by the best citizens of the town, and Sunday is kept by them no holier than any other day, As to the mechanics"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9386/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9389/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9386/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1837 Jun. 17 Franklin, [to] James M.
