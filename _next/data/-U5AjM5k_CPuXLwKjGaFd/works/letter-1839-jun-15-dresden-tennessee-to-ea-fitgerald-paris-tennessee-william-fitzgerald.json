Cowan deserves to lose the negro for the silly parade he has made about the negroes honesty and faith &C and et cetera - whenever there is any good feeling or good faith from a slave to the owner it must be when human nature has undergone a revolution. true there are some who are our contented but it is those of a very low grade of intellect - Sam is a man of more sense than Cowan & besides a sly and insinuating scoundrel I am in fine health and buoyant spirits having pretty well mastered my business here. on yesterday I was applied to - to know if I would become attorney for the Bank at Trenten . there business will be worth $1000. or 1500. per annum. I will say easily done. I do not know whether I will get it or not.. Mr Mister Patten who is entirely competent is in the spot & it would seem that it would be more convenient for all parties to imploy employ him but this is for your own eyes My love to the children Yr Your husband Wm William Fitzgerald"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5364/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5366/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5364/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1839 Jun. 15, Dresden, Tennessee [to] E.A.
