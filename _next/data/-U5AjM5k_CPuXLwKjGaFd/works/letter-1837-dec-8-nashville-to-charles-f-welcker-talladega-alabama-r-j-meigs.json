Alabama paper, to obtain Seven or eight thousand dollars in Kentucky paper?\" I find on enquiry, that Kentucky paper sold today at 10 per cent for Tennessee; and the brokers say it varies from 9 to 10. They buy in small amounts at 8, and sell at 9 or 10. One to whom I spoke said he could accommodate you with 7 or 8 thousand dollars at almost any time in Kentucky paper for Tennessee & Alabama at 10, or in U.S. paper, so as to enable you to get Kentucky paper at about the same difference. The difference between U.S. paper & Ky. Kentucky here is 2, so that you would have to pay 12 for U.S. in Ten. Tennessee or Ala. paper. Give my respects to Chilton , Hogan, Genl. General Bradford their families, and all my friends. Yours truly R. J. Meigs Mr. Charles F.
