You are awa aware that last year he by abscense absence , negligence & other causes did not accomplish the required course in that class and was indulged until this session to make up his deficiency. On his return here I found that he had failed to comply with this requisition I had a long conversation with him last week in which I stated that he might if he wished, by double exertion to regain his position to regain the good opinion of his teachers; and the friends of the College study partly in the Freshman & partly in the sophmore sophomore and that I would reduce the complete course required in the Freshman Mathem atics to the smallest amount required to understand the rest of the course.

If he does not avail himself of the present occassion occasion diligently I should consider it impossible for us to do thing more and would then recommend that you place him elsewhere. He has now a boarding house in which I think he will be less exposed to the temptations which surrounded him last year. You will receive from me a report showing his advance & conduct at the end of this quarter. Your son has been here one week to day without entering the college the regulation forbid him remaining in town unless he does regularly enroll himself before the end of the week, As however he informs me that he has written to you with regard to the classes he wishes to enter I have determined to suspend the regulation for the present until he receives an answer from you.
