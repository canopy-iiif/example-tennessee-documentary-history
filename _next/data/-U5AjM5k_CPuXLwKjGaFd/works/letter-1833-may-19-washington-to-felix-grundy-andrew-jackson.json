I am in some doubt whether I should reply to your interrogatories, as any answer I can give may not protect me from the charge of interfering in the choice of Senator, soon to be made by the legislature of Tennessee . But the fear of this imputation ought not to prevent an answer, so far as my knowledge of the relation in which you stand to the question proposed may be necessary to do you justice. Under this obligation therefore I feel at liberty to repeat now what I have often said before in conversation: that your conduct during the last session of Congress in opposition to the absurd and wicked doctrines of Nullification and Secession was highly useful & energetic and throughout, as far as I could judge from your votes and conversation, no one could have manifested a greater zeal to give effect to the measures of the Administration. In stating thus generally my opinion of your conduct in the Senate, on the subjects alluded to, I trust no one will infer that I have any other object in view, but of satisfying you that I am incapable of doing you injustice. With the choice which the Legislature are called upon to make I can have nothing to do. Believe me very sincerely Your Obt. Servt Obedient Servant Andrew Jackson The Hon. Honorable Felix Grundy True copies of the originals in my possession.
