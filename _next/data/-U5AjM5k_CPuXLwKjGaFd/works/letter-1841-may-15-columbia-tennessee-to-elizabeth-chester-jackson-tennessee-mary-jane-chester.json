But Mamma I have not received a letter from you for so long a time that I am affraid afraid that Sister is worse. Do if you please write me how she is. The Mail has just arrived and no letter for me, indeed I do feel very uneasy. Now that the sickly season is comming coming I cannot be satisfied with less than one letter a Week. If Sister is well eneough enough to write, I want her to write to me. I think as I have so many Brothers some of them might write to me often. Yesterday we all went to church to hear Genl. General Harrison funeral, preached by Bishop Polk . (I believe it was his funeral, or at least something about him) It was the best sermon that I have heard since I have been Columbia, but I being quite weak slept most of the time, but I have no doubt that you will say that it was very wrong for me to do so.

Mrs Walker is I beleive believe no better. I do not think she can possibly recover. I went to see her a week or two since she looks very badly indeed, her health is so bad that neither Cousin Jane nor Mary Eliza could come to see me whilst I sick. But Mrs Smith was so very kind to me that I did not mind their neglect. (For neglect I must call it so none of the Family came or Sent to see how I was the whole time.) Has Aunt Narcissa received my letter yet. If she has tell her she must answer it very soon. I cannot give her much praise for her regularity in writing to me, and as for Aunt P. Patsy I do not know what to think of her. But I suppose I must excuse her as she very seldom writes to any one but Uncle Will . Tell Uncle the he must not permit our Correspondance Correspondence to be discontinued so soon. You remember that Cousin Jane Rawlings wrote me one letter, well, that is the only one that I have ever received from her. And the ⁁ same way with Aunt France . I suppose that Sister and Mary Hays have \"fine times\" together. O! how much I wish to be at home to see them. Tell Mary Ormand that I have never received the letter that she said she was going to write me. I expect that she can almost write sure enough, for she is so smart about every thing that she undertakes. I should like to see her and King walking hand in hand for they both do look so very sweet. I received a letter from Eliza Bigelow saying that Bet Hale , and Lizzy McNeil , were expected to be in Jackson this Month. I was very glad to hear it for I want to see Bet very much indeed. I have only Six more weeks to stay here then I expect to be so very very happy.

I was very much amused at the girls that were sick when I was There were two who imagined themselves very sick, but no one thought so. they thought that their Parents ought to know about them, so they got things for writing and wrote a very long and mournful letter and gave it to Mrs Smith to read.
