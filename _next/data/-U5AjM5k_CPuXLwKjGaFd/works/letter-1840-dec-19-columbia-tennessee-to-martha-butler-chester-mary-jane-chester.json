I know that I would not have treated you as you have treated me. but I will forgive you if you will promise to be a better correspondent hereafter. If you know how much pleasure it gave me to receive your letter, I know that you would write to me again. Mother wrote me three or four weeks ago saying that ⁁ both you and brother John intended writing that week to me, but I expect that you have forgotten me by this time. Sister please anser answer this letter as soon as you receive it, it would releive relieve my mind to see that you have not forgotten me. You cannot imagine ⁁ how much disappointed I was to hear that Aunt Narcissa was not comming coming up to see me, but I was as much delighted to hear that Papa was coming up. I wondor wonder how I shall spend my Christmas the first one that I ever spent from home. You will all be so happy at home the very name of home makes me feel happy. I never knew how much I loved you all until I left home. There is no place like home according to my oppinion opinion . Sis Sister I am affraid afraid that you cannot read this printed letter for it is the first one that I ever trid tried to print.
