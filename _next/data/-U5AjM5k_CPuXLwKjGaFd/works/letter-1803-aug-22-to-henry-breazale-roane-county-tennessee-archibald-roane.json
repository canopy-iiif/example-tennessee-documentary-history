As I have no doubt Trainum is guilty of horse stealing and from the circumstances believe him guilty of the robbery and murder above stated I am anxious that he should be apprehended for trial and wish you could make such enquiries as migh might lead to a discovery whether he has been in his old range on clinch , and what rout he has gone, whether he has deposited money there &c etcetera I have thought it might be prudent to conceal the information respecting the murder until some further intelligence can be had respecting him.
