It is in a good neighbourhood neighborhood , bounded on the South, by Bays Mountain and on the North by poor ridges. On the Sabbath I addressed the people on the great subject of my agency After I had closed, Dr Rev Reverend added some well timed remarks. We obtained a pledge of $ 17. collected some frinds friends , and organised organized the Mossy Creek Bible Society. The frinds friends collected were left with the Treasurer until he could obtain more. I think the Society will gradually increase and do much good. From that neighbourhood I went to Beans Station , via Rutledge, where I spent two days, preached on Saturday and Sabbath I formed a small Bible Society containing some about fifty members, some fifteen of whom are coloured colored people, who take a deep interest in the cause, paying $3.00 of what was collected.

I there formed the Beth Carr Bible Society, ? collected for it $8.23. and obtained aditional additional pledges, most of which will be, if they have not already been paid. This Society is designed to supply with Bibles Testerments Testaments a poor destitute section which lies between the Chucky and French Broad rivers , north of the Paint Mountain . They have a great work to perform; with small means. I have situated places for these Small Societies where they could do much, as distributors \"of other man's bounties\" I think it is better to have small societies than Bible Committies Committees .

The Holston Conference held its session within seven miles of Ashville Asheville . Bishop Jones was there and a fresh impulse was given to the Bible Cause. Rev-ern Langdon ; Agent of the A N.e.

The Methodists and Baptists have small Societies out there. I also left ten Bibles with a pious lady, Miss Eliza Jane Coutter , fifteen miles South of Greenville Greeneville , near Paint Mountain. I have heard of many some affecting cases of destitution, but deem it unnecessary to relate them, unless they were uncommonly touching . I then passed through Greenville Greeneville in which place I am hereafter to make a special effort, via Rhea Towers , to Jonesboro , to meet a Sabbath appointment of 3 weeks standing. It was a rainy time on Sabbath, we collected a respectable congregations however, at 12 O'clock, in the Presbyterian Church, and organised reorganized or organised reorganized a Bible Society which I presume has been officially reported.

This Society intends to supply the County Sunday Schools with Testaments. I believe it will do well. Monday 13th I drove to Blountville, Sullivan Co County and finished the organization of a Society previously convened there. I collecd collected of the Treasurer $38.86 over what had been paid for carriage on the 3 boxes. The people in that place are waking up to the subject, and before the close of the year, they will probably dispose of nearly a thousand Bibles, and more than that number of Testaments increasing your funds some $500.00 From Blountville I went to Scott County Va. Virginia taking with me an aditional additional supply of one hundred and thirteen Bibles and Testaments. I made arrangements to have most of these sold in Scott and Lee Counties, by several responsible individuals, who will cheerfully serve the good cause without charge From these parts I returned and passed through Kingsport , and was glad to find that the Society there had received their books and were doing well. I came on through Rogersville , also , where I shall make a spiral effort, in due time. I had an appointment at this place on Friday evening, which I attended to, The Society which I found here 3 weeks ago is doing well, for a small place I have now closed my monthly report The prospects are brightening.
