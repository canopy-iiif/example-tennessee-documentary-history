Permit us to observe, however, that the society in whose behalf we speak, entertains the most large liberal designs; that its members reside in seven states of the union, the only reason why they are not found in every state is the impracticability of their meeting to transact business, if so widely dispersed; that it has patrons friends in all the states of the union; that its members are not confined to any religious denomination; that it disowns all narrow, local or party views, seeks to do good by aiding in the moral improvement of our fellow-men, whereever accessible, who have not yet enjoyed the blessings of civilization christianity; that it regards with peculiar interest the wants of the Aborigines within our own borders; that it acknowledges with gratitude the favorable regards the important aid of government; that it will not solicit the patronage of government for any object, to which the members of the society are not ready to contribute their property, their time their labour labor ."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/652/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:656/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/652/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Letter, 1818 July 15, Washington to John C.
