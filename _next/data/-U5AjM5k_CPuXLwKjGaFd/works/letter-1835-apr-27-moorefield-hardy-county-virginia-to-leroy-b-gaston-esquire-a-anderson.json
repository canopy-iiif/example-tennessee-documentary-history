February 2nd past marked the 13th came to hand in the early part of the present month; an answer to which has been purposely deferred until this moment. You are aware that the month of April is to our profession in Va Virginia a month of business — The Cir. Sup. Circuit Superior Courts throng us — Our Elections take place — & all the et ceteras of such like occasions. In addition to all this — our muddy — haggard village, has in the providence of God been honoured honored with the Session of the Winchester Presbytery — which took its leave of us this morning. For these reasons & with the expectation of deriving some interesting intelligence from these scenes — I intentionally forewent (will that were pass) my usual promptitude, in replying to your anxiously looked for & welcomely recd received epistle. It is my purpose now to redeem my pledge & to gratify, in part at least, your wishes — You emphatically urge me to write — but what shall I write ? Nothingness & vanity seem inscribed upon every thing around me — & an incubus of dejection is loading me with its leaden weights. The heavens are shrouded in darkness — & my mind sympathetically partakes of the gloom — With such feelings & under such circumstances — you will realize but little pleasure in the presence of a barren & lifeless epistle. But such as I have I give out thee. You express the wish — that when I started my friend Joe Fellows for the South — I had stuck to him & thus been dragged out of this slough of despond — Our wishes are mutual. But dire necessity or the illusions of hope — have fixed me to the spot — & altho although it is any thing other than an oasis — I can not tear myself from it — as yet . True I am not of the seed-royal — Either by descent or adoption nor will I ever be by matrimonial amalgamation. But having a little of the old roman spirit in me — I cannot but assert my rights — nor shall it e'er be said of me — \"He was banished the land of his birth or adoption\" — In plain English — you know Efforts have ever been making by some of the line to expel me from their borders — & to fix the brand of a stranger upon my forehead & exclude me from their little comth of privileges — & the means have been as various as their desires.
