For when in the wagon we had for our seats, cooking vessels, sacks of bacon and meal, saddle-bags, blankets, c. et cetera , of which the greater part, as well as the sides of the wagon, were besmeared with grease and filth.

A little before sunset we arrived at our lodging place for the night, Owing to the fatigue of the day, and having been somewhat unwell before, by this time I was greatly afflicted with a pain in my head, which was attended with considerable fever. Very soon, notwithstanding, chains were produced, and the prisoners directed to sit together. As I was indisposed, I requested the privilege of lying down before the chains were put on me.

We had twenty two miles to ride. Both our driver and road were literally rough, and our passage consequently rough. At two o'clock, P.M., we came in sight of the camp. The prisoners were directed to walk, and the guard to march in close order. Before the wagon rode two of the guard; immediately behind were the prisoners; while the remaining part of the company brought up the rear. As we approached the camp, the massy gates leading into the yard were opened by the sentinel within, and with all due formality the wagon, prisoners, and guard moved onward, passing in front of the quarters of Col. Sanford , Col. Nelson , and those of all the privates, when we found ourselves at the jail. A halt was made. The door was unlocked; and with peculiar emphasis it was said to the prisoners, \"This is your house.\" We entered. The door was locked, and I began to survey the mansion to which I had been conducted with so much military display. But soon a messenger at the door turns the key and announces that Col. Sanford wished to see me at his quarters. With him I had a few moments conversation, and he then said that I was at liberty to go where I pleased.
