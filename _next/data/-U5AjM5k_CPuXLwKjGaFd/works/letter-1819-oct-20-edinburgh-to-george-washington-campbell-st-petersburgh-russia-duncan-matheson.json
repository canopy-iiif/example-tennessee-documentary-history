Understanding however from your brother that my name & situation are not unknown to you. I have mustered resolution enough to trouble you on a piece of business which is shortly as follows. My Brother James went out to a mercantile house in Calcutta in 1815 ; and through their favour favor and his own deserts, he has now, at the age of only 23, been lucky enough to get himself established with considerable patronage as a Chinese Agent at Canton , where if he remains for some time, he has every prospect of making a handsome fortune. He writes me however that so far as British Subjects are concerned, our English East India Company have the monopoly of the China Trade, so that any subject of this Country can only remain there by the indulgence of the East India Company's Superb ous, and are liable to be removed at their pleasure. Now tho though this right is sel and perhaps never very arbitrarily, it must be a most desirable ob aid of so grievous a restraint upon h liberty; and one ed, and an individual made in of the English Su mself nominated, as is the case with either Consul or Vice C for some foreign power; as every foreign power has the same right there with English East India Company, whose monopoly takes effect against their own Country men only.
