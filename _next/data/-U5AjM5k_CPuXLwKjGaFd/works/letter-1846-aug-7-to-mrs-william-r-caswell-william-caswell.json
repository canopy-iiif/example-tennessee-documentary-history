I wrote to you from Orleans & gave you all the news I could think of. Since then I have but little news to write. We embarked on board this fine boat on wednesday Tuesday evening— the 5 General officers, their aids, & many other officers in the Quarter Master & Pay departments— with two companies of Illinois Volunteers, our servants and our saddle horses. Wednesday evening we passed down the Mis. Mississippi river, the coast or banks near the city are in a fine state of improvement— we passed the battle ground. Genl General . Butler who was a captain in the battle pointed out the lines of our army, the advance of the enemy & related many interesting incidents relative to the death of Packenham, the defeat of the British &c and et cetera — When we \"turned out\" of our state rooms next morning we were near the mouth of the river, the \"Balize\"— The land on either side, over grown with a rank grass, but too soft for cultivation & notwithstanding we occasionally came to a cabin inhabited— tho' though it is said that nothing but a Frenchman or a bull frog, could live in such a place— at the mouth of the river there is a light house, and other buildings— We met a good many vessels near the mouth of the river, in the Mis. Mississippi & in the gulf, for the commerce of Orleans is immense— and this war, has, and will continue of immense advantage to the City— The citizens avail themselves of it, by charging most exorbitant prices for every thing— for example, we paid $36—for two mess chests or boxes to hold our provisions $10— for a pair of blankets— $7— for two cots— $10 for collar & cuffs on Genl.
