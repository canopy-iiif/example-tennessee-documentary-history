William Seger of this city. The assignment of the same from the latter to me is now enclosed together with an abstract of the account itself This claim has been long since virtually, though not in form, conveyed to me by Mr. Seger; but I was willing to leave the collection of it to himself having confidence in him and he assuring me from time to time that the money would be soon forthcoming my patience however is now exhausted. I understand Mr Poyzer to be a Gentleman not only of substance but of respectability and I shall therefore be very sorry to be under the necessity of adopting coercive measures against him: these, however you must put in force"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:6654/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1815 Jul. 18, New York [to] John Dickenson, Nashville, Tennessee / Samuel Ferguson : page 2"]},"width":3128,"height":3816,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:6653~datastream~JP2/full/391,477/0/default.jpg","width":391,"height":477,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:6653~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/1/page/tdh:6653","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/1/page/tdh:6653/656b66c751a9f","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:6653~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3128,"height":3816,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:6653~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/6651/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"unless he will immediately give his notes for the full amount, payable at yr your Bank in sixty or ninety days; and if in your judgement his own name is not indubitably safe for the amount you must demand an endorser, or some other good collateral security.
