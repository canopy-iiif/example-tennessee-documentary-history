I left the notes with Messrs Messieurs Simpson, McAlister & Co Company for collection in April or May 1849 . One of the notes fell due on the 1st of July of that year and the other on the 1st of January 1850 . With verbal instructions to make the money when it fell due and although I have written repeatedly to the house of S. McA. & Co Simpson McAlister & Company I have never been able to hear from them but once and then they informed me that the notes had been put into the hands of Mr Irvine for collection. I greatly fear that the gentleman have so far neglected my interest any instructions as to cause me to lose a good deal of my claim if so and I have any hold on them at law I will make them smart for it, however that is \"inter nos\", Continue to do the best you can.
