I understand that our town is receiving other benefits besides the matrimonial ones, she will soon be a large and beautiful city. You have heard no doubt before this of the rascally set of resolutions the Legislature of Vermont sent the United States Senate, with a petition as long is my arm praying that slavery be prohibited, and a thousand other things too foolish to mention The most vilainous villainous thing that could be done, and will at length bring evil war among us.

I have no particular news, The winter has been uncommonly mild, generally but for the last few days it has been geting getting colder every day and until the first of March. I expect to see very little pleasant weather; There is large quantities of ice in the river, but it has not frozen over, it is expected it will tonight.
