On my first arrival in the Territory, I much confess that I was not very well pleased with the country; in consequence of the scarcity of timber. The land in the neighbourhood neighborhood of St Louis lies very handsomely & is quite rich, but in many places there are extensive tracts of country of entire meadow; without a solitary stick of timber__ yet to compensate for the want of timber, coal mines are abundant. As I proceeded on up the Missouri , I became more & more pleased; until in fine, I have gotten to a Country, where I feel willing to stop; as I never expect to find a better. The land in the neighbourhood of this place, is beautifully situated & well timbered to a great distance . The soil is of the best quality & generally well watered__ the atmosphere pure & healthfull healthful . Every vegitable vegetable that is known to flourish in so northern a latitude, may be cultivated to advantage here. It is perhaps one of the best Countries, for the growth of wheat, that the eye of man ever beheld__ tobacco grows luxuriantly. More corn has been raised to the acre here (if my information be correct,) than can be raised in any part of west Tennessee _ Rye, oats, barley, buck-wheat, turnips, potatoes, &c etcetera are raised in great perfection. Cotton grows much better than could be expected, in a climate so far north; yeh it is said to be rather a precarious crop. The Missouri bottoms are mostly alluvion, or in other words made land; the soil from eight to ten feet deep_ the mean width, from three to four miles.

There is no Country upon the globe better adapted to the raising of stock; the truth is, as fine stock may be raised in this Country as on any part of the continent without ever costing the farmer a solitary cent. The woods & natural meadows are covered of all seasons with grass as high as a mans head; so that stock require no other food, except it is hogs & there is always a sufficiency of most to keep them fat_ salt springs abound throughout the Territory; so that they require no salt. The Missouri is a beautiful stream, but runs with a rapid current; which renders the navigation up the river somewhat difficulty: though it is said by boatsmen who have navigated both the Missouri & Mississippi , that the navigation of the former is not more difficult than that of the latter, from the mouth of the Ohio up to St Louis. There are one or two steam boats now fitting out, to navigate the Missouri from its mouth to the mouth of the yealow tone a distance by water; of eighteen hundred miles.
