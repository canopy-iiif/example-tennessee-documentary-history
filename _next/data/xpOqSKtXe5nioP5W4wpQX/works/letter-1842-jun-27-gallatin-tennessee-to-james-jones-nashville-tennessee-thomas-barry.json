It seems to me that every member of the present Legislature who had rather serve his country than hold office is under such a state of things bound to resign I should doubt the Patriotism of any man who would cling and hold on to office when he knows by pursueing pursuing that course the very best interest of those who gave him his office must suffer you will please therefore accept of this as my resignation of the seat I hold in the present General Assembly of the State of Tennessee To his Excellency James C.
