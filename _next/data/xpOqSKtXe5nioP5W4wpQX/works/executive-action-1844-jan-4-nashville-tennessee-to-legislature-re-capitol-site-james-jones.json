I do not know that I fully comprehend the intention of the General Assembly in the first Resolution; if however it is your intention (and I presume it was) that I should occupy the house as a residence, I want beg leave most respectfully to decline the honor, fully appreciating, as I can the kind intentions that suggested the adoption of the Resolution. The second Resolution provides, that the Brick edifice on the ground shall be occupied by the Secretary of State; thus, I regard as a wise provision, as the office at present occupied by that officer is insufficient for a business office, and a library room. If the General Assembly shall think proper to give other direction to the Executive in regard to the public grounds, they will be most cheerfully attended to.
