Memphis is said to be a good market. If you conclude to send him here I will do all I can to sell him to the best advantage, By the bye speaking of buying negroes I would like to purchase from you Emily and Mu??ch her daughter ( you got ⁁ them from Clinton Heslep .) It has always been the wish of Mrs C Coffee — and myself to repurchase them whenever we were able to do so, and I will feel it a particular obligation if you will let me take them off of your hands. I know nothing of the Cotton Market, for I never enquire about it. The overflow of the city still continues though it has not increased for some time You have no doubt seen accounts of the death of the old hero Gen General Gaines , he was to old to be of Service to the country, but he was so proud a man that he is a serious loss to us Give my regards to Ann, Ma & the family and be Your Brother Andrew J.
