I therefore take the liberty of making the following enquiries of you. 1st Whether you were not intimately acquainted with my conduct in relation to the great questions of Nullification and Secession during the whole of the last Session of congress? 2d. Whether you had not full opportunities, not only of knowing my conduct, but also my private feelings on these subjects? 3d. Whether any member of congress, laboured labored with more zeal and assiduity to put down the doctrines of Nullification and Secession than I did? 4th Whether my whole energies were not directed to sustain the Administration in the great conflict in which it was compelled to engaged on the above subjects?
