Dear Sir:- Doubtless you are apprised of the horrors of the \"African Slave Trade,\" by which over 80,000 Africans are exported from Africa annually, and sold into bondage; and how ineffectual the policy pursued for many years by the United States , England , and France , has been to effect its suppression, and likewise their fruitless expenditure of money to the amount of over one hundred million of dollars. And likewise, we suppose, you know how much good has been accomplished by colonization. A few benevolent men in this land having settled and erected the Republic of Liberia , for the sum of not more than one million dollars, which sum would not support the American Squadron on the African coast three years. And further we suppose that you are acquainted with the doings of the British Parliament on this subject, from whose movements we learn that the English Government desires to change the policy of blockading the coast of Africa into that of settling said coast with colonists. After reminding you of these facts, we respectfully request that you will use your influence in securing a change of our national policy on this point, and have the thousands of dollars that are regularly voted to the support of the African Squadron diverted in part from that object, and applied to maintaining a line of transports, which shall carry our free people of color who desire to emigrate to Africa. In doing this you will render a great service to the American Colonization Society, which is unable to meet the growing demand for mean of transportation. Yours respectfully, J. Mitchell , Agent A. C. American Colonization Society. Indianapolis , Dec. December 13, 1849 .
