How pleasant to have a friend to whom we can on all occasions unbosom our whole heart.

How this evil is to be remidied remedied , in the present ignorant, & vitiated state of society I Know not For in the choice of men to represent us in that body, we see that merit in the estimation of the Electors, is but a minor consideration. Hence untill we become more wise & more virtuous, we shall in this respect be no better off. It appears to me, that all the other states so far as my information goes, are improving. But poor Tennessee, is retrograding or at best stationary. I take no pleasure in entertaining this opinion of the country which I love above all others.
