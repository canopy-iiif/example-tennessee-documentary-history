I expect it was about such information as I received thro' through Majr. C. Major Campbell I have only received one letter from you (and that was by Lieut. Lieutenant Turnley ) Since I left home. I suppose my letters have been sent to San Antonio . - If I had recd. received them I should have had many of my anxious conjectures explained, relative to your heath health & comfort, relative to Eliza, to our little boy - to your Ma, & Mary, Alfred , Henry , Ann & our family, our servants, our neighbours neighbors - & c et cetera - What has become of Thos. Thomas M. Anderson - If he is at home - tell him to write me all the little neighbourhood neighborhood news - and direct his letter to \" Captain Wm. R William Richard . Caswell \" \" Care of Brig. Gen. Brigadier General Pillow .\" \" Hd Irs. 2nd Brigade. U.S.A United States of America \". \" Mexico \"- And so you can direct your letters; But I cannot tell where our Head Quarters may be when a letter will reach me from home, after you receive this..
