I received two letters from you, for which I thank you, but have had no opportunity of returning answers. As to money I can assure you it is hard times, so much so indeed that I should think myself acting improperly should I fix upon any time for you to expect the money I owe you. If you could purchase land for horses I would let you have one or two very low, even at your own price. Judgments were obtained against me at the last term in Nelson for upwards of $400, for which much of my property I expect will be sacrificed, unless preserved by the interposetion interposition of friends, and they are scarce. My school is not large a consederable considerable part, of the proceeds of which, goes to support my little family; the balance to my creditors .
