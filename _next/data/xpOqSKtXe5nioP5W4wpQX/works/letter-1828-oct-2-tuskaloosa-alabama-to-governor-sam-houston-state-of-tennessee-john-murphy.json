By a very munificent Act of the last Session of the Congress of the United States the source of a very considerable fan has been placed at the disposition of the State of Alabama for the opening a Canal around the obstruction of the Navigation at the Muscle Shoals , a work highly important to this State & I should suppose not less interesting to the State of Tennessee. But even the accomplishment of this object, so much and so long desired, and which must unquestionably prove of so great utility to a large portion of the States of Alabama and Tennessee, will not affect every thing everything which I hope may be conveniently done for their advantage, and which will give to these interesting portions of both States, the full benefit of their great natural resources. The improvement at the Muscle Shoals, will open the great Market of New Orleans to East Tennessee , and to a large part of the State of Alabama on the Tennessee River .

The Market of New Orleans, however, important as it must ever be in general, will be frequently attended with material disadvantages. It must often be overtaken in the produce which Tennessee and Alabama would have occasion to lend to it, and this state of things must become continually more perplexing, as the improvement of the immense valley of the Mississippi progresses. The City of Mobile would be more free from this inconvenience, & will in general, I think, afford a better Market for the produce of this State of and East Tennessee, than the City of New Orleans. There would also be the advantage, of passing on that commercial route through the consuming Country, for many of the Articles, and giving to the grower the advantage of selling immediately to the consumer. At all events, by opening both Markets, very singular benefits must be obtained, and then would be afforded to our citizens every possible means of selling their produce at a fair price, and perhaps of making exchanges highly beneficial to all parties. But I extend merely to hint at these subjects in the present communication. An intercourse with Mobile must be opened by Canal or Rail Road, connecting the Navigable waters of the Tennessee River with Steam Boat Navigation on the Alabama.
