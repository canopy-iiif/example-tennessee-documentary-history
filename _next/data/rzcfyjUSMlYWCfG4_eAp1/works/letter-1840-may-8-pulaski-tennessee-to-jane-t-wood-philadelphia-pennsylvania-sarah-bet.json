I declare it beats bob tail. I expect by this time Hate Hearney is a married man; we received a letter from him a few days ago, and he was to start the next day for his license. I believe he is to be be united in the silken hands of matrimony to Miss Mary Harris of Vicksburg . I am not going to believe it until I hear that he is married He is always going to be married but never makes it out, at least has not heretofore. You wish to know what had become of Dave Reynolds .
