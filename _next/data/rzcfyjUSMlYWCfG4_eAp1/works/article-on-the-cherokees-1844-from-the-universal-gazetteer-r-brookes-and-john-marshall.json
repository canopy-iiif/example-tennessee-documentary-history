Some of their chieftains have been really great men, fully sensible of the disadvantages of their condition, and sagacious in devising a means to remedy them. Among these chieftains, the late Charles Hicks , and John Ross , now at the head of the nation, were preeminent. Under their directing councils, and aided by the policy of the general government, they have outstripped all the other tribes in the march of improvement. The natives carry on considerable trade with the adjoining states, and some of they them carry their cotton down the Tennessee , and even down the River Mississippi to New Orleans .
