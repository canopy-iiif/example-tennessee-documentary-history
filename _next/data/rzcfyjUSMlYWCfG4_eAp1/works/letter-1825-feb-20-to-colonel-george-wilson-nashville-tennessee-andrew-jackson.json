This to my mind is the most open daring corruption that has ever shewn itself under our government, and if not checked by the people, will lead to open direct bribery in less than twenty years— for what is this barter of office for votes but bribery— Mr Clay is prostrate here in the minds of all honest & honourable honorable men— What will be his fate in Kentucky I cannot say, but Mr Bibb who is here, says this act will promote him in Kentucky. I recd received your letter and disposed of it as you had directed, I regret I had not it in my power to serve you, it will give me pleasure when occasion occurs.
