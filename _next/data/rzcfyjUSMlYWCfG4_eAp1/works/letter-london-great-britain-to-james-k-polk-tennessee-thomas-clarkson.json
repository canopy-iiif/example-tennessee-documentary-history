Slavery and the Slave trade are violations of this great principle; the assumption by man of the right of property in man, is in open opposition to the pure and righteous law of God, and hence the perpetuation of these crimes has ever been found to obstruct the happiness of man, oppression and cruelty are their certain attendants, they have their origin in pride and avarice, and they ferment and strengthen all the evil passions of the human heart."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7728/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7731/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7728/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] London, Great Britain [to] James K.

The Slave trade continues to exist in an aggravated form. It is estimated that upwards of three hundred thousand human beings are annually sacrificed on the continent of Africa in the prosecution of this wicked traffic, in addition, upwards of seventy thousand are annually transferred from the older, to the more newly settled Slave States in the United States of America ; Millions of the human race are also still retained in unrighteous and cruel bondage. This convention therefore being solemnly impressed with a sense of the National sin of Slavery and the Slave trade, and under a settled conviction that the only effectual means to put an end to the Slave trade is to abolish Slavery; does most earnestly and respectfully appeal to the Governor of Tennessee, to employ all that influence and power with which divine providence has entrusted him_____ to secure immediate and unconditional liberty to the Slave. It is high time that the Civilized world, and more especially the Nations which bear the Christian name, should purge themselves from these foul abominations; we open our mouth for the dumb, and plead for our Brethren who cannot plead for themselves; The Lord Jesus Christ died upon the Cross equally for them as for us Great Britain has at length manumitted the Slaves"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7728/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:7730/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/7728/canvas/2","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] London, Great Britain [to] James K.
