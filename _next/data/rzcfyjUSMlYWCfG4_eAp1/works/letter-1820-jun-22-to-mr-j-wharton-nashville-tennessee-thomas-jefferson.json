The transactions of which it asks information, are of 40 years date. The crowded scenes thro' through which I have passed within that period, wish a memory in the wane of age, have so far obliterated them from my mind as to be quite unable to give any account of them which would merit attention. I can only say in general that my best recollections concur with the statement you have sent me from Genl. General Smith . I think that is accurate. The instruction given by myself as Governor to Jn. John Walker and Smith I well remember an apprehension that a peace was patching up in Europe on the principle of Uti possidetis, induced us hastily to ascertain where our boundary struck the Mississippi, and to take possession by a fort which we directed Genl.
