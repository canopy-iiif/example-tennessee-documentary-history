service and property of ordering, at the time it may done, Captain James Cowans Cowan Company into service to act as rangers, or a Militia Cavalry, on the frontier of Franklin County in this state, for the protection of the Inhabitants of that County, which from its exposed situation to Indian depredation, and from the actual murders which had been just before committed there, by Indians, was indespensably indispensable necessary to be done, to keep that frontier settlement from being entirely abandoned by the settlers — That County including much of Cumberland Mountain , and extensive frontier, very contiguous to Indian settlements, is very broken and mountainous, so much so, that marauding parties of the Enemy might be concealed, or elude the vigilence vigilance of any Company smaller than the one ordered into service, for a considerable time; during which, they might commit many murders — that Company was called out upon the recommendation, and upon the application for
