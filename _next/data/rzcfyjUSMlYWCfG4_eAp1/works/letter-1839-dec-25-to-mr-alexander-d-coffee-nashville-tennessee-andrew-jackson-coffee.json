Andrew and myself will farm it together this coming year & in that time I will be able to buy a farm some where, or other. I succeeded very well indeed in my trip of Surveying and will make several hundred dollars by it. There is no news that I can hear of so I will only add at your requests made to Ma some time since. I send you ten dollars, which I hope will amply supply you, All unite in love to you and relations and wish you a speedy and honorable end of your Colegiate Collegiate career, until I see you or write to you again Farewell, Your affectionate Brother A.
