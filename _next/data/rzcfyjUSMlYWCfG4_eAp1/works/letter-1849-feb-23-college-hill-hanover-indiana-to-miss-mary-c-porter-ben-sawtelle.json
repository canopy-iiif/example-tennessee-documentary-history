I had almost given up in despair, thinking that you were so much engaged with your old Friends, and enjoying yourself so well, that you never gave a passing thought to \"Ben\", but how agreeably was he surprised, when that welcome word yes! greeted his ears and a letter was handed out, with the welcome, and well known direction. As you state in your letter where you were when you wrote, I will tell you where I am, conversing, as you say, by means of pen, ink and paper with a loved one, far distant. I am sitting, at my little desk, in \"Sky Parlor\" not alone, as the other boys are making plenty of noise, but I manage to write some way. It is Friday night, we have been down to the river to see some of the students off, tell Ed Edward Pat Walker is off for good. We all being somewhat fatigued, concluded not to go to society. It is quite muddy, and it has been debated with some spirit, whether there was any \" Terra Firma\" in, or about Hanover, except on a large rock. You ask me if it is not to good to think of, to converse face to face. I answer it is, for me. Yet my imagination will often take wings and fly to the land of the \"Sunny South\", and there rest amid the memories of many happy scenes past, and gone. And in my dreams, do I revisit \"home\" and see my friends, and am happy. But the visions of night are false, and I awake to find my self in Hanover. I have two homes , one where my Father is, the other where my Mother is. I feel very thankful to you all for being so kind as to let me come home, the session is out just 5 weeks from yesterday. I have a Valedictory to deliver before our Society, and I just commenced it. I am very hard pressed for time, I have little, very little time I can call my own.

But I am afraid I shall feel lost in thier their company, as I have been in thier their company, that is of young Ladies, So few times scince since I left Memphis. And if I am somewhat awkard awkward , you all will know the reason. I have not been over to see Miss Anna , to tell her I had recieved received a letter from you, but I must go tomorrow. Mr Nelson is quite sick. The Young Ladies of this place say I am in love with a Miss Katie Woodard , because I said she was the handsomest girl in town. On account of that I cannot succeed with any of them. They do not make much as I care for none of them, and there is no love lost, on either side. A few days ago, we all went up to Madison to see Old Tuck and I saw the old Hero. I will give you the particulars when I get home. I recieved received a letter from Cy Clapp a few days ago. He spent his Christmas vacation at B — They were all well. He is in fine spirits, and wants to get married, which is more than I want to do. You ask me why I did not send that ring to you by Ed Edward or Bunyan . I will tell you truth. I hated to part with it. I was on the point of giving it up, several times, but I could not let it go. It has not been off my finger scince since I left M — Memphis nor shall it until I am there. I do not know whether you will have to let the folks see this or not, but I would rather you would read it to them. I am sorry Bunyan has left M — Memphis .

Mrs Tillon is up here now. She enquired about you yesterday. The Boys here say, or rather remarking, that they do dislike to get with a Young Lady who says only Yessir! No Sir! So do I. I have been unwell a little lately but have nevertheless tended recitations. I caught a bad cold, for I never caught a good one, and it settled in my head. I attend singing school every Thursday evening for a hour. Rev Reverend Crowe is teacher. The young Ladies attend, that is if any of the young men go with them, none of them get there by my help. Tell Ed. Edward , that Kalfus is setting up to Miss Tuba like 40 You must have had some very fine times at the Donation Party, as you was mistress of ceremonies. I gave some of the particulars to some of our good Abolitionists. They were somewhat surprised. That was quite an adventure which you relate. Did not the poor young man faint? I fear he would have hurt himself, if you had pushed him over the Falls. I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing the Chap sometime, I just wish to see how he looks. You ought to have given me a description of him. I hope my Friends Miss H & R Miller are prospering finely. I think a heape heap of them. My love to them.
