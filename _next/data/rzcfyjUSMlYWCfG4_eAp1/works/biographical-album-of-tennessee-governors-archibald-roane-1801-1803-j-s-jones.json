He was educated for the law and\n\t\t\t was a fine scholar.He was admitted to the Tennessee bar at \n\t\t\t Jonesboro and \n\t\t\t Greeneville, \n\t\t\t 1778, and the same year he was\n\t\t\t appointed Attorney-General for the district of \n\t\t\t Hamilton. Was a member of the\n\t\t\t Constitutional Convention \n\t\t\t 1796. When the State was organized\n\t\t\t Roane was elected one of the Superior Judges for the State. \n\t\t\t 1801John Sevier retired from the Gonvernorship\n\t\t\t and Roane was elected without opposition. He gave offense to Sevier by casting\n\t\t\t his vote as Governor against him and for \n\t\t\t Andrew Jackson for Major-General, and at\n\t\t\t the next gubernatorial election Sevier defeated him overwhelmingly in spite of\n\t\t\t General Jackson's influence. The vote stood, Roane 4,923; Sevier, 6,480. Roane\n\t\t\t then retired from political life until \n\t\t\t 1815, when he was appointed one of\n\t\t\t the Supreme Judges of the State. This office he held until his death, which\n\t\t\t occurred in \n\t\t\t 1818.He is said to have been a highly cultured gentleman, and to have had\n\t\t\t an aversion to the turmoils of the political life of his day. While he was\n\t\t\t Governor of Tennessee the State was laid off into three Congressional districts\n\t\t\t to-wit: \n\t\t\t Washington, Hamilton, and \n\t\t\t Mero. \n\t\t\t Knoxville was the capital of the State."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9556/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9558/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9556/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Biographical Album of Tennessee Governors [Archibald Roane--1801-1803] / J.
