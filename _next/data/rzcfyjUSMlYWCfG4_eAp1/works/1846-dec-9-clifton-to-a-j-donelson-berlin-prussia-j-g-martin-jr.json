Dear Sir. I received a letter from Mr Duncan a few days since, containing The tax receipts on all your Arks Arkansas lands for this year, amounting to $116, which Mr Duncan paid in county seriffs and Arkansas money for $89. I settled this sum by Mr Duncans draft on me in favour favor of Wm William E Woodruff . Cousin Daniel paid me $42.50, which I supposed would be half the Taxes at the time it was received. Mr Duncan writes that there is but little prospect of selling any of your lands in Ark. Arkansas at this time, but that emigrants are expected in Clark & Union Counties in this month and January. I have written to him, requesting that he would inform me if he should hear of any one that wishes to purchase any of your land, and telling him that any of your lands in Arkansas can be had for $150 pr per acre cash or $200 one third cash the balance in one and two years with good secured notes: I have made him an offer of your entire interest in Arks lands for $1500 cash; if he will give this, I think we had better accept it, but this I would not do until I should get your consent. for the present I have abandoned the idea of going to Arks this winter, and unless I have more favourable favorable accounts of the probability of selling your lands, I will postpone my trip until next winter. I saw your overseer Mr Smith on yesterday, who was busy repairing your Cotton press. he has employed Mr Jackson to assist him at $1.00 pr day, and says he can have the job completed for about $10.00: he finished pecking"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5846/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:5850/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/5846/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["1846 Dec. 9, Clifton [to] A.
