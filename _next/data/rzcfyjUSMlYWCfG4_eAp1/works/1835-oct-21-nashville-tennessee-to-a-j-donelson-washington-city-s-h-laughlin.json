Your communication for the Union has been given to the public as you will have seen. The further course I shall take in relation to the matter of the franks, and the new remarks of the Banner, you will see next week. The papers will inform you of the progress our new General Assembly is making in the business of President making. What they will do with Ridley 's resolutions, now lying on the table of the House, specifically approving severally of the leading measures of the administration, and of the conduct of the President separately in relation to each, yet remains to be seen. These resolutions are framed with a special view of having a distinct vote taken in relation to each important measure. It will be a sore pill to some hypocrites and some apostates to be forced to vote in that way, but they will be compelled to do it or disgrace themselves by giving the go by, in some way, to the whole in a mass. — In debate, we have decidedly the advantage of talents.

In the Senate, Craighead — and ⁁ I rather hoped for than expected it — is taking good ground. But even up to this time, it is very much undecided how a good many respectable members will finally stand on the great questions which now agitate the state growing out of the Presidential controversy. Matters on hand, as they arise, which you would not learn from the papers, I will communicate in such hasty letters as I can find time to write at least once or twice a week. Tomorrow, the people of Maury are to give Col. Polk a dinner at Mooresville . Mr Grundy started out as a guest on yesterday, and is to make a speech. I have besought ⁁ him as with tears to cry aloud and spare not. The time has actually arrived here now, when, as Mr. G. Grundy said of the sword in his war circular of 1812, \"cursed is he that keepeth back himself from the fight, or holdeth back his means.\" That we will win the day next year I feel no reasonable fears, but ⁁ it will be by a hand fought battle.

May of Illinois , I find that the delegation of that state have the matter much at heart. This correspondence was sought by Gov. R. Reynolds with a view of consulting our friends here. He informed me that he had written to Mr. Blair on the subject. I wrote also to Mr. Blair but have received no answer. I am entirely sure that Shields , Huntsman and Dunlap of our delegation will all go with Johnson in supporting Polk against Bell. In Illinois, at least one paper two papers — the Springfield Republican and St. Clair Gazette — have avowed their preference for Col. P. as has been ⁁ also done by the Democrat, if not others in Alabama . The Albany Osgers , I think, gives an intimation in its remarks on Col. Polks speech of June last. This, however, is a weighty matter which can only be adjusted after our friends get to Washington . It is a matter, however, of great importance here, for we now feel certain that if Bell finds he can't beat Polk himself, he is determined to try to have it done by another, and he would like to have that other to be one of our friends.
