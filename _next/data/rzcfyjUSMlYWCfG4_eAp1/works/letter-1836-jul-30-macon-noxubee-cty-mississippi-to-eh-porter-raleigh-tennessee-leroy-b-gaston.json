My opinion, from the best information recd received is that you will do well by occupying the stand at Aberdeen at as early a date as you possibly can. It is the most eligible point= and commands a more extensive fertile section of country than any other I have heard spoken of, unless it be Gainsville some distance below. The latter place had the advantages of being more central and accessible. They are both cut-off in a measure, from a winter intercourse with the interiour interior by the prairies, a season of the the year too the most important for the advantage of your business. It would be a spur and spring to the business which I think would never subside, and would add incalculably to its profits, were you to occupy one of those stands this fall. I would earnestly advise, if possible, to forego some of your already conceived plans, and strain a point to do so. The farming interest of the country is just now in the stage of incipiency, and presents the fairest opportunity that it ever will for you to lay fast hold of it. I would suggest that you send Mr Charr if you have no one to spare from your own shop to put in one of those places.

A railroad from that place will in all probability be constructed across the prairies sometime in the course of next year; And it is destined to become a place of some importance.— I have myself gone into business with my brother in merchandizing. I bought out his former partners interest, at cost and six pr. ct. per cent upon 12 mos. months time. And I am here now on a purchase of Articles that we need to replenish the stock, which we are now obliged to do in consequence of this former partner's having failed to go to Mobile according to promise. We get goods from overstocked merchants in this place at New York cost and twenty pr ct per cent with 6 & 12 mos months time. Our stand is a moderately good one; but we intend dividing and occupying another and a better stand as it is represented to be. As I am in haste I must be brief. Give the above information to any friend or interested person who may inquire after me. I think at this time that it may be possible for me to be in Raleigh about the first of Novr. November next, as I have some idea of going to New York and making that in my rout route . Tell Mr. Reinhardt that when I get leisure enough I will write to him and give him a history in full of matters & things in general. Keep what things you have of mine yet on hand that were contained in the box. They are movable, and worth more to me now I have a prospect of being settled than I can probably get for them.
