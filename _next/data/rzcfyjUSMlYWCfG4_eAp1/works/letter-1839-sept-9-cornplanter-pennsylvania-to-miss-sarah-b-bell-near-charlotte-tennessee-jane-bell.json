We have had 3 of Mr. Wm William Bells sons of Pittsburg Pittsburgh staying here for a month and only left two days ago. The oldest is 17 — and is a very promising youth, indeed they are all very interesting, and I am indebted to them for more of a home feeling than I have experienced since I have been here. Could I see more of our relations, particularly my own family or rather some of my father's I should be better reconciled to the seperation separation from the others. At present I feel quite low spirited, and am in constant dred dread that each mail will bring me an account of my father's death.
