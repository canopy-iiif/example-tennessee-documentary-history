By 1807 the federal government abandoned Tellico and moved the rest of its agency to the Hiawassee River post, the new center of the Overhill Cherokee settlement. Excavations of the Tellico Blockhouse were conducted by the University of Tennessee from 1972-1974 in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir.
