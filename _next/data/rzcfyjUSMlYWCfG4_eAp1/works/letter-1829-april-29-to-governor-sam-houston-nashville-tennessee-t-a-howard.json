Tennessee 29 Apl. April 1829 My dear friend, Since my arrival here, I saw your resignation of the office of Chief-magistrate of this State, and I need not tell you that such an item of intelligence, excited my deepest regret.— To remain silent, when my friend had deemed it proper to take such a course, at the moment at which his country was was holding out to him the most flattering prospect of a renewal of her confidence, would be unpardonable, and would prove me recreant to every principle of noble and generous friendship.— The confidence I have ever reposed in you, forbids me to imagine that the course was within rank or ill advised; and whilst I deplore the event, and regret with the utmost poignancy, the existence of causes, which may have led to this unexpected and unwelcome catastrophe, permit me to assure you to assure you in the sincerity of my heart, that the spirit of friendship unabated, and of confidence undiminished continues to animate my bosom to wards towards you. — In retiring from the scene of political life, you ought to remember that you are still Houston; that although you may have misfortunes unforeseen, and therefore unprovided against visited upon you, yet that these things should not be permitted to drink up your spirits, or to prostrate him whose enemies could not in the days of prosperity find the means to destroy.— Go where you will, — let whatever destiny await you which an inscrutable providence may appoint, I shall still remember with the highest feelings of friendship our mutual and unqualified attachments. May heaven preserve you. T. A.
