I waited patiently at my friends store, which commanded a view of the river, until 10 O'clock in the evening, & no boat coming, I went to the hotel & retired for the night with directions to be called if a boat came down, I slept on quietly till about 10 O'clock, when I heard boats & expected any moment to be called, but no person came to do so for a considerable length of time, & I concluded they were going up the river, at last the boy came & told me that there were 2 boats at the landing, one for St. Louis & the other for N. New Orleans , I was up & down to the landing in a very few minutes, but when I got there the boat I was going to take, viz. the one for St. Louis, was going, the other was still there & they said they would overtake the St. Louis boat by the time they reached the mouth of the Ohio , So on board I went, but as something was the matter with her forcing pumps, we went very slowly, & when we reached the mouth, the other boat"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9448/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:9452/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/9448/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 25 Dec. 1846, Memphis, Tenn[essee] [to] Mrs. Charles E.
