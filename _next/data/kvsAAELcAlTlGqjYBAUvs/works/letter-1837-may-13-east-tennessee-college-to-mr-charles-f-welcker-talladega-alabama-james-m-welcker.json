When I left Taladega Talladega last fall I intended to have written soon after I arrived home; but owing to some cause or other, not to be attributed in any degree, either to any coolness or indifference for any of you, I have deferred it untill until this late period.

A few days past Father sent us your letter of March the 31; In regard to which, I have truly to say, that no inteligence intelligence , ever reached us, from you, from which we derived so little pleasure. To hear that any of you is well, is indeed, to us, at all times the greatest satisfaction; but to hear of your distresses of sickness and death is equally grievous. And I have only to state that they do not reside upon you alone, but are mutual; Further more they are such as none can change or amend. We have a letter here, that was written by brother Lewis to Father a few days after he reached Taroahote Terre Haute .
