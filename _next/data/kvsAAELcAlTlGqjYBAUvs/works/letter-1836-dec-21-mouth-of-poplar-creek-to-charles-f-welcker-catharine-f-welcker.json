December 21 1836 Dear Brother As I expect you are desirous of hearing about the mil mill I will relate a few particulars about it. Father was up there a few weeks since and he says if you do not sell it soon there will be nothing to sell as it looks like a few more high waters would carry it away. Cook does not saw any for people he did not even saw the stocks that Nail delivered ther there . he said that they were not worth sawing and so they laid there until the high water Came and carried the most of them away Cook has got the rent corn halled hauled he thinks that there is 300 bushels but Father says that there is not more than half so much if that. I suppose Henry told you that Major Burris and Monroe were buying hogs. Father will have about 3000 weight of bacon to sell and he says if you can give him 10 cents per pound that he will send it to you by some of the botsmen boatsmen the meet meat is small"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/82/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:85/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/82/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1836 Dec. 21, Mouth of Poplar Creek [to] Charles F.
