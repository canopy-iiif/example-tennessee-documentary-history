To be sure, I have not much strengthened any obligation resting on you to write, by keeping up the shot myself, and now that I am seated for the purpose of writing I am somewhat at a loss for something to say You learned months ago that I was at the General Assembly last spring and it may be, have already declared vengeance against the \"Indian Chief.\" I mean on account of some of the transactions of the Assembly respecting your presbytery &c et cetera . I should perhaps have written on this subject long ago, but a press of business of various kinds (it may be, mixed with a good stock of mental laziness) has prevented me till now.

On last tuesday night our camp meeting on Cane Hill closed. It resulted in the hopeful conversion of not less than thirty one, out of which, I hope the Lord will make more or less preachers.
