I have been further informed (not official) that one other person has been murdered near the Shoals , said to be done by the creeks Creeks . Such enormities are of too agravating aggravating a kind, and such as will not be longer suffered, to be committed on any of the citizens of Tennessee . I request you will be good enough to make diligent enquiry in order to discover the perpetrators that they may be dealt with agreeably to existing Treaties, and the laws in such cases made and provided. I am unwilling to believe that the Cherokee chiefs would countenance such outrages, but should it be discovered to be otherwise, this situation may soon become very disagreeable, unless they finally put an end to such aggressions.
