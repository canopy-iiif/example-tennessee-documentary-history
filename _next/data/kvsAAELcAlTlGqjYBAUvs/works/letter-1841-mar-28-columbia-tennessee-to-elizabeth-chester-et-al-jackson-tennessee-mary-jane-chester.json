I have concluded to write to you my dear Father I have no news to tell you so you must be satisfied with a very short & uninteresting letter. I was very much grieved to hear that Mama was so sick when you arrived at home but I hope by this time that she is perfectly recovered — If she is it would give me so much pleasure to receive a letter from her — Papa you cannot imagine how much pleasure your visit gave ⁁ me but I wish to see almost as much as I did before you came, I wish that you all would live in Columbia, how until I finish my Education, I know that it is a very selfish wish but you know it is impossible for human nature to be without some portion of selfishness. I was very much pleased to hear that Aunt Patsey has recovered her health. I expect that her sickness was occasioned by Uncle Will's absence but now that the time is so fast approaching for him to return she will get well I can assure you then. As soon as Uncle returns I want him to write me a long letter for he has never written me one line since I been away from home but I can can can excuse that as he has not been at ho me When he returns I must have a letter from him. Aunt Walker has had a very severe spell since — O she has suffered so much, they were all very uneasy about her, but they think that she is something better this morning. I have not been there since you left Columbia, for Mr Smith is so very strict about us leaving the Institute. I suppose that you have received the third Number of the Guardian. there is an account of every thing respecting Miss Julia Gordon . Some of her own writings Papa you cannot imagine how much she was beloved by all her class mates. Tell Cousin Dick that he must answer my letter soon. Tell Jack Hays that I should like to receive a letter. I suppose that Mary Ormand can almost write a letter.

Cousin Ophelia Hays sent for Miss Bills , Kate Bowen , & myself to go out there & remain until Saturay Saturday evening, and when we asked permission to go Mr F. G. Smith said that we must be at home (My home now the Institute) by Sunset. We were determined that we would not break his rules. so we got home just in time, so we were sitting out in the Front Porch when here comes Mr Smith (bowing all the time) Why young ladies it is more than I expected, I said Mr — You must have a very had opinion of us No indeed but I thought perhaps that you might be tempted to break the rules. Nevertheless the Western District stands very very high in my estimation. Mama you must not think that I am trying to praise myself but just to think of Mr S — Smith being so deceitful. I do not like so much as I use to. I told Papa when he was here that I was not going to take lessons in Music from Mrs Smith any but I am very happy to inform him & you that the new teacher has left the Institute & I still continue to take lessons from Mrs Smith. I am very much pleased with her mode of teaching. Mama how does the Parlour Parlor look without the Piano. I am glad that it is gone, but still I cannot help from feeling sorry. The Rose bush that you sent me is growing very prettily. I was very much pleased with all the things that you sent me. I wish that I was at home to see some of your beautiful flowers— I know that every thing looks so pretty. Is aunt Narcissa as fond of her Garden as ever.
