December 1815 Sir When I enterd entered Pensacola in the month of Nov. November 1814 , a Battery in the main street mounted with two French Fours , was opened upon my column, which was immediately charged & carried. These peices pieces , it is beleived believed , were landed by the British, & were British property: — The Spaniards have never claimed them Having good carriages they were conveyed to Mobile , where they remained until the restoration of peace, when the officer commanding at that fort ( Col. Wm Colonel William P Anderson ) was directed to have them, with their equipments forwarded to Nashville with the discharged militia: The Colonel dismounted them, & sent only the barrels. The threatened hostility of the Indians on the Mississippi induced me to have them remounted & made ready for the field — The expence expense attending which (amounting to $ 258) has been paid out of the public funds, under the rapposition that they had become the property of the United States On this subject, the circumstances of which are thus laid before you, I wish some order to be taken. If the government cannot consider them as the property of the nation & shall refuse to receive them the expence expense of recounting them will be charged to me & the guns ⁁ be subject to resoudes at my ⁁ own disposition I have the honor & c et cetera Andrew Jackson Mjor Genl Comd.
