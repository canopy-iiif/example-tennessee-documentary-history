County you will get the letter. We have no news of much interest from the Army. Genl General Scott has arrested Genls Generals Worth and Pillow for disrespect and also some junior officers have become involved in the same snare . It is a disgrace all around, a disgrace to Genl General Scott for the manner in which he made the arrests & a disgrace to the officers for the matter of the arrest and I see by the Washington Correspondent of the \"Picayune\" that it has been decided to recall the whole of them and place either Genl General Taylor or Butler in command. I hope it may be so & that those officers implicated may all be dismissed the Service. The people who write from Mexico talk about peace but I do not know what new ground they have to stand on. I am fearfull fearful that it will be many years before we have peace again, but still I do not despair, the Anti war speeches of such men a Calhoun & Crittenden are extensively republished in Mexico and do an immencity immensity of harm in misleading the Mexican people as to the real sentiment in this"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:8734/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1848 Jan. 15 New Orleans, [to] Alex[ander D Coffee] / Andrew J[ackson] Coffee : page 2"]},"width":3131,"height":3858,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2/full/391,482/0/default.jpg","width":391,"height":482,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/page/tdh:8733","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/page/tdh:8733/656b68f5c2306","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3131,"height":3858,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~tdh:8733~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/annopage-1","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/8731/canvas/1/annopage-1/annotation-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"country towards them.

The Judge has the verry very place to suit him and I hope he will have luck to make just decisions and an upright Judge, he looks well and was in fine spirits & gave me a good deal of information of what was going forward at Montgomery.
