By the blessing of an indulgent God, my Family are all alive, and in good health, for which I try to be thankful. I have written several times to you, and have received no answer, yet such is the love I have for you; and such my great desire to converse with you, and such is the distance between us, that writing is our only alternative, and though I get no answer to many of my letters, I must, I will keep writing, and you have but one way to stop me, and that will be to write to me, to trouble you no more, and by that means I will get one more:__ I used too think, and cannot yet but think, that you were a man of another stamp; than to forget your friends by a few years separation , Instead of forgeting forgetting you, I think I have thought more about you, and about old times, for a few months past than ever I did. Yes, with pain, and pleasure I look back on the sweet and pleasant days, and years we spent in the vineyard togeather together , indeed I view them amongst the happiest hours ever rolled with me, I then had a Father to council, an aid in the Ministry, a dear companion in labour labor , an experienced Presbyter, and one in whom I had the utmost confidence, both as to his skill and aim; But the return of the spring reminds me of repairing to Gods House to council with my Breathren Brethren the best means to effect the end of promoting the redeemers Kingdom: With a down-cast-eye, and heavy heart; I ask myself where is Presbytery? and with whom will I meet? and on whom will I lean? The answer is what most pains my heart,__ It is not Uncle Fines, Bro,, Brother John , Harris Chapman &c and etcetera &c &c But it is with a few unexperienced Boys and there is not one to look up to and what will give me most pain of all, is that with which you used to be pressed, by me, and others, ( viz videlicet ) when any of our members in Presbytery, rises to speak they will, I fear address themselves to me instead of the moderator, You no doubt recollect we used to pretend to address the Moderator But would look at and in truth address Uncle Fines.
