The decision was that we were to consider The cumberland Presbyterians , as an independent body of Christians a decision honorable in my estimation to the cause of religion & one that removes difficulties that I have felt in my mind. I have nothing highly important in regard to the state of religion here. There is an increased attention to Meetings & some seriousness on the minds of several. five were added to my church at our last communion two weeks since three of whom on the hopeful subjects of renewing grace written a fiew few months past.
