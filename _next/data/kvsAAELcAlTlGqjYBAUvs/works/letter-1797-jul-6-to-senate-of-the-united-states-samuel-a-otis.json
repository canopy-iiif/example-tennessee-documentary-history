Dear Carey , I wished to have seen you, before I returned to Philadelphia ; but I am obliged to return to the session of Congress, which commences on the 15th of May . Among other things that I wished to have seen you about, was the business Captain Chesholm mentioned to the British Minister last winter at Philadelphia. I believe, but am not quite sure, that the plan then talked of will be attempted this fall; and if it is attempted, it will be in a much a larger way than then talked of; and if the Indians act their part, I have no doubt but it will succeed.

Any power or consequence he gets will be against our plan. Perhaps Rogers, who has no office to lose, is the best man to give out talks against Hawkins.

This sort of talk will be throwing all the blame off me, upon the late President, and as he is now out of office, it will be of no consequence how much the Indians blame him.

Your Committee are therefore fully persuaded that the original letter now produced was written and sent to Carey by Mr. Blount.
