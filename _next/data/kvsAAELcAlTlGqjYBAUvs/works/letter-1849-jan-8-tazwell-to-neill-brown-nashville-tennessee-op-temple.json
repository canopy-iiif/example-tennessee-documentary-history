The movement, I apprehend, will secure the conscience of a large and respectable portion of the people. Those who advocate it do so on the ground that we have been deprived of our Senator. A writer in the Knoxville Tribune of last week goes so far as to say that the Whigs of this end of the State will not support any person but an East Tennessean for that office. But I am confident that the writer is mistaken, and that no such disposition exists in the great mass of the Whigs A few may have such feelings the common people never have been dissatisfied with the election of Bell to half the extent that a person at a distance would imagine from certain articles in the news papers.
