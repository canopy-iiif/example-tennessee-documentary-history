INDIAN NATIONS. October 13, 1818 MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE CHEROKEES . (From the Raleigh Register .) Mr. Gales -The articles of intelligence I gave you some weeks ago respecting the Cherokee Indians seem to have been so well received by the public, that I am led to expect a further account of that nation would not now be unacceptable. The interest which appears to have been excited bears honorable testimony to the liberal and charitable feelings of our countrymen. I now send you a notice of some of the peculiar manners and customs of the Cherokees , drawn up a few months ago by Charles Hicks , a chief of the nation, at the request of My. Mr. Hoyt , the missionary, and by me copied., in June last , from the mission diary. The original was the diction and hand writing of the chief, and was recorded nearly in his own words. Charles Hicks is a half blooded Cherokee , has a tolerable education, is a man of intelligence and piety, and has long filled the office next in rank to the king. The latter is a full blooded Indian, who has no acquaintance with our language. At a late national council, it was enacted that no order of the king should take effect until approved and concurred in by Charles Hicks . This virtually makes him equal to the king, but in in g f luence and real authority he is greatly his superior. He is a staunch friend to the whites, a zealous promoter of the measures now in progress to educate and civilize his nation, and at this moment has a son in publi l c school in Connecticut .
