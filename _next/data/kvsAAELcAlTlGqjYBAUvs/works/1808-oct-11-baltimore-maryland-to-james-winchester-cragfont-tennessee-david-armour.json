Octr October 11th 1808 General James Winchester Sir I sent you some time ago a Statement of the money paid me, for my Clame Claim against Foster , which you was so good as to collect for me and will thank you to Inform me if you are satisfyed satisfied that I am Correct, As you very truly observe, our political hemisphere lowers indeed, and tempest Clouds and darkness Seems to hang over us, and I am very fearfull fearful that it will be some time before the Sun of our prosperity will again be able to dissipate them, Those whom I think to be the truest friends of the country have a host of Evels Evils to encounter, it is not alone, the tyrannical measures of her enemys enemies abroad which they have to War against, but they have to fight at home (as a venerable Senator of Vermont says) with against every thing but Trouth Truth & Justice could any good man who loves his Country, have supposed that America could have produced Such men, as we see Inlisted Enlisted against their Countries peace prosperity & Independence alas Sir, is the patriotism of their Fathers buryed buried with them in the Silent Grave and nothing permited permitted but the rank weeds of Ambition and revange revenge to Spring up in its place, it almost appears so to me, I fear our past prosperity has destroyed our National virtue and the enemys of our liberty wants to convince us that all Nations most must be ruled with a rod of Iron, I do however yet trust, that they shall be disappointed, it is not the honest Federalist that I am afraid of, it is the ambitious and designing traitors who ranks themselves among that class of
