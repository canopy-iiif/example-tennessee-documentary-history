When I came first into this Agency a single Blacksmith only was employed. his pay & rations amounted to 376 dollars pr. per annum besides the pay of a striker at the anvil, for which I paid from 8 to 10 dollars pr. month. As the natives advanced in Agriculture it was found that a single B. smith Blacksmith only placed in any part of the great extent of Indian settlements was of only of very partial advantage: many had to come 100 miles for the smiths work. to remedy this the present mode was adopted, that is, of permitting Blacksmiths to come into the nation who should have no dependance dependence on the Government except by compliance with my orders in favor of Indians for Smiths work, at the same price paid in the white settlements. There are now 15 Blacksmiths within this Agency. 5 of which are Cherokees, self taught. they are so dispersed in the nation as to render great service to the natives. Many of the Indians pay for their own smith work- the white B. smiths are allowed to till as much land as they please for raising corn & to keep live stock. It appears to me sir that there cannot be a better plan adopted at present in this agency than the one used. The spining spinning wheels are provided in the same way- there are two white men & two real Cherokees who make spining wheels- they comply with my"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1640/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:1643/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/tdh/1640/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["[Letter] 1816 Nov. 4, Cherokee Agency [to] W[illia]m H.

The Looms for weaving are nearly all made by Indians. for which, the price is eight dollars only a piece. It is my opinion that if mechanics should be employed in the pay of Government_ a tin plate worker only excepted, that they the indians would place too much dependence on that source, which would lessen their own enterprize in mechanical arts, & retard their improvement. The present mode of furnishing them with B. smiths work is less expensive than any other, so it appears to me. I mean in this Agency- other Agencies may require other arrangements: Necessity or interest has induced them to some exertions- many of them now tan their own leather- they make shoes- and there is one good saddler a Cherokee. they have too many silver smiths. they make the rich Hatbands , Arm bands, & other ornaments of dress, & silver spurrs spurs equal to any I ever saw. If a Tinplate worker could be employed for One or two years it would be of much use. who should be agreed with to instruct a number of young Cherokees in the art of his profession. the Cherokees now pay a great deal of money for tin ware. it being usefull useful in every family. I estimate the expense of a good workman in that business at at 305 $ pr. year he finding his own tools_ the tin plates to be provided by Government. and the whole of this expense may be saved by returning the expense gradually from the present expense of other presents.
