I was much gratified to find that you your Indian friends had the entire disposal of this important matter- this arrangement will resound equally to the honor of Winfield General Scott the government to the comfort I trust, satisfaction of the Cherokees , under the trying painful circumstances, in which, all have been placed. I congratulate you therefore your friends, upon the happy determination of this branch of the subject. I have now a proposition to make, to which I invite your serious consideration that of your Cherokee friends. On establishing yourselves in the West, you will, besides subsistence, necessarily require for the use of all your people, a great quantity variety of articles necessary to their comfort well being- Such as woolens cottons, for clothes- blankets- hardware of all sorts- glass- agricultural implements- mechanics tools- groceries- arms powder c c et cetera et cetera - all these can in greater or lesser quantities, be doubtless bought, in the West, from Merchants Traders; who foreseeing your wants may have goods ready to supply them.

Instead of relying upon such a source, would it not be better to make your purchases directly from this section of the Country? to have the goods sent by way of New Orleans to such designated points, in your Arkansas Country, as might be accessible by water most convenient to you?
